            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Now then it appeareth (as I haue ſaid) that hee hath dealt fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently with me two wayes,</hi> the one <hi>in referring my ſuppoſition to all the lawes, whereof I treated, whereas I referred the ſame expreſly, and only to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill law: the other, &amp;c.</hi> Thus M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert.</hi>

               </gap>udicious <hi>Reader,</hi> and cauſe him to be iealous of his ſinceritie in the reſt of his <hi>Replyes,</hi> when at the very firſt entrance hee ſhould finde in him ſuch fraudulent proceeding. For that which I affirmed is very true, and I meruaile, that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> doth not bluſh to deny the ſame, to wit, <hi>that hee did firſt of all,</hi> that is, at the very firſt beginning of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in the <hi>ſixt</hi> page of his <hi>Supplement,</hi> before hee began to prooue the oath to bee repugnant to any law Diuine, or Humane, <hi>ſuppoſe that the Popes power to excommunicate and depoſe Princes (if they deſerue it, and the good of the Church, and the ſaluation of ſoules doe neceſſarily require it) is denied in this oath.</hi> For theſe be his expreſſe words in the <hi>ſixt</hi> page, and <hi>ninth</hi> number of his <hi>Supplement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6 <hi>Therefore I thinke good to let him vnderſtand heere, that my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is not to contradict any article of the oath, that concerneth meerely Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill obedience to our Soueraigne, but ſuch clauſes only, as doe either direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or indirectly preiudice the authoritie of our ſpirituall ſupreame Paſtour, and namely thoſe which doe exempt temporall Princes from excommunication and depoſition by the</hi> Pope, <hi>when iuſt occaſion ſhall be giuen by them, and the neceſſitie of the Church, and the good of ſoules require it: to which purpoſe I will prooue</hi> (marke well theſe words) <hi>that this new oath in reſpect of ſuch clauſes is repugnant to all lawes Humane, and Diuine, and therefore iuſtly condemned by his</hi> Holineſſe, <hi>and refuſed by Catholikes.

            <p n="7">7 Wherefore it is apparant, that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> in the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Diſcourſe referreth his aforeſaid ſuppoſition to all lawes both Humane, and Diuine, and yet now to taxe mee of fraude, hee doth not bluſh to ſay, that I haue dealt fraudulently with him in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his aforeſaide ſuppoſition to all the lawes whereof hee treateth, <hi>whereas,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hee referred the ſame expreſly and onely to the Ciuill law:</hi> Which errour of his I would not willingly haue conſtrued in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer ſenſe but attribute it only to his obliuion, and forgetfulneſſe of what he himſelfe had written in the beginning of his Diſcourſe, and not to any fraude in him, but that my wordes which hee himſelfe doth relate, are ſo plaine, that he cannot bee excuſed either from manifeſt fraude, or
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:150436:19"/>
from ſo palpable an errour, which no man of vnderſtanding can ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commit. For marke my words, which he himſelfe ſetteth downe. <hi>Firſt of all he</hi> [M. <hi>Fitz.] ſuppoſeth that the</hi> Popes <hi>power to excommunicate, and depoſe Princes, is denyed in this oath;</hi> wherupon afterwards (to wit, in the 66. page, as it is euident by my quotation) <hi>hee concludeth, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the oath doth not expreſly affirme, that the</hi> Kings Maieſtie <hi>is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame head of the Engliſh Church, nor in plaine words deny the</hi> Pope <hi>ſo to be, yet it ſuppoſeth, and implieth both the one, and the other, and thereupon denyeth the</hi> Popes <hi>authoritie to excommunicate and depoſe a temporall Prince, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8 Now who ſeeth not, that I did cleerely diſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>firſt of all,</hi> and <hi>afterwards,</hi> betwixt <hi>his ſuppoſition,</hi> which I referred <hi>to first of all,</hi> and to the beginning of his diſcourſe in the <hi>ſixth</hi> page, before he began to treat of any of the lawes, as alſo it may euidently appeare by thoſe words of mine, <hi>This being ſuppoſed hee laboureth to prooue,</hi> &amp;c, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his <hi>concluſion,</hi> which I referred to <hi>afterwards,</hi> and quoted the 66. page, where he treateth in particular of the Ciuill law.

            <p n="11">11 For albeit he doeth boldly affirme, and ſuppoſe, that the <hi>Popes</hi> power to <hi>excommunicate,</hi> and to depoſe Princes is denied in this oath, and conſequently, if the <hi>Popes</hi> power to <hi>excommunicate</hi> Princes be not denied therein, his poſition, or <hi>copulatiue</hi> propoſition is falſe, for that to the truth of a <hi>copulatiue</hi> propoſition it is required, that both parts of the copulation bee true, and to make it falſe, it ſufficeth that one onely part of the copulation be falſe, yet he bringeth no one argument in his whole Diſcourſe to prooue, that the <hi>Popes</hi> power to <hi>excommunicate</hi> Princes is denied in the oath, but cunningly paſſeth ouer to his power to depoſe, which all men confeſſe to be expreſly denied therein.

               <hi>that the Oath implieth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall of the</hi> Popes Supremacy (he ſhould haue ſaid of the <hi>Popes</hi> autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to <hi>excommunicate</hi> and depoſe a temporall Prince, for this was his ſuppoſition, as I cleerely ſhewed before) <hi>Thou ſhalt vnderſtand,</hi> good Reader, <hi>that I was mooued thereto by two reaſons, which are manifeſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in the very place, which</hi> Widdrington <hi>citeth: The one was, becauſe it is euident, that the faith and beliefe of all Engliſh Proteſtants is, that the</hi> Kings Maieſtie <hi>is no way ſubiect to the</hi> Pope, <hi>but that hee is himſelfe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame head of the Church of God, in England. Whereupon it may with great reaſon bee inferred, that the deniall of the</hi> Popes <hi>power to depoſe his</hi> Maieſtie, <hi>which is expreſly contained in the oath, is ſuppoſed and implied therein, as a neceſſary conſequent of their beliefe, who ordained it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="30">30 <hi>For it is great reaſon to interprete all aſſertions, poſitions, lawes, or decrees (eſpecially ſuch as touch Religion) according to the doctrine and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of the Authors thereof, for it is to bee preſumed, that euerie one ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, writeth, and decreeth, according to the grounds and principles of his beliefe and Religion, as euery Artiſan worketh according to the grounds and principles of his Art. And therefore, as the poſitions, aſſertions, and decrees of knowne and profeſſed Catholikes are to bee interpreted according to the grounds of the Catholike faith, ſo alſo the poſitions of all Sectaries whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer are to be vnderſtood according to the different doctrines of their Sects: In ſo much, that if a Catholike and a Proteſtant ſhould affirme both of them one thing (which might be controuerſed in reſpect of Religion) the ſenſe and meaning of either of them is to be interpreted according to their different Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, and their different grounds, and ſenſe thereof. And vpon this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:150436:25"/>
I made no doubt to affirme, that the new oath, denying the</hi> Popes <hi>power to depoſe his</hi> Maieſtie <hi>implieth the deniall of the</hi> Popes Supremacie; <hi>for that not onely his</hi> Maieſtie, <hi>but alſo all they of the Parliament which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed it, doe holde and beleeue, that the</hi> Pope <hi>can not depoſe his</hi> Maieſtie, <hi>becauſe hee hath no authoritie at all in England, and eſpecially ouer his</hi> Maieſtie.</p>
            <p n="31">31 <hi>My other reaſon was the ſame that I touched before, concerning the neceſſary deduction of the</hi> Popes <hi>power to depoſe Princes from his Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Supremacy: for albeit the Supremacy of the</hi> Pope <hi>be not expreſly abiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or denied by this oath, yet it is denied couertly by a neceſſary conſequent, becauſe his authoritie to depoſe Princes (which is neceſſarily deduced from the ſupreame power that Chriſt gaue him) is denied thereby: as in like caſe, if wee ſhould deny that his</hi> Maieſtie <hi>hath any lawfull power to ſuſpend, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue the</hi> Arch-biſhop <hi>of</hi> Canterburie, <hi>all Protestants would ſay, that we deny not onely his Eccleſiasticall Supremacy, but alſo his temporall and Kingly authoritie, becauſe the power to ſuſpend and depriue Biſhops within his Realme, is included therein, and neceſſarily deduced from it in the opinion of all Proteſtants.

            <p n="32">32 But <hi>first</hi> of all, <hi>good Reader,</hi> I wiſh thee to conſider, how cunningly this my <hi>Aduerſary</hi> concealeth the <hi>first</hi> part of his ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerning the denyall of the <hi>Popes</hi> power to <hi>excommunicate,</hi> whereof onely I vnderſtood thoſe words whereon hee groundeth his <hi>third</hi> accuſation. In the beginning of his Diſcourſe he ſuppoſed, as you haue ſeene, that the Popes ſpirituall Supremacie is denyed in this oath, for that his power to <hi>excommunicate</hi> and depoſe Princes is denyed therein. And becauſe his <hi>Maieſty</hi> had in expreſſe words publikely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, that his intention was not to denie in this oath the <hi>Popes</hi> power to <hi>excommunicate,</hi> anſwering alſo the argument, which Cardinall <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> out of thoſe words of the oath (<hi>notwithſtanding any ſentence of Excommunication</hi> &amp;c.) brought to prooue the contrarie: and becauſe my <hi>Aduerſarie</hi> did alſo without any proofe at all, ſuppoſe, as Fa. <hi>Gretzer</hi> had done before him, that the Popes power to <hi>excommunicate,</hi> and conſequently his ſpirituall Supremacie is denyed therein, for this cauſe I vſed thoſe words, that <hi>truely it is a wonder, that learned men doe not bluſh</hi> &amp;c. which my <hi>Aduerſary</hi> a little before carped at. Now, <hi>forſooth,</hi> he pretending to yeeld a reaſon of his ſuppoſition, yet yeeldeth none at all concerning this parte thereof touching the <hi>Popes</hi> power to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate,</hi> for which onely I vſed the aforeſaid words, and which
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:150436:25"/>
if he could ſufficiently prooue to be denyed in this oath, all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes would forthwith graunt him, that the oath containeth a denyall of the Popes ſpirituall Supremacie, which includeth as a generall the particular authoritie to inflict ſpirituall Cenſures, but he cunningly paſſeth ouer to the <hi>Popes</hi> power to depoſe Princes, which no man doubteth, but is denyed in this oath, &amp; yeeldeth <hi>two</hi> reaſons, ſuch ones as they be, why he ſuppoſed the oath to containe a denyall of the <hi>Popes Supremacy,</hi> for that the <hi>Popes</hi> power to depoſe Princes is denied therein.</p>
            <p n="33">33 His <hi>ſecond</hi> reaſon (for thereof I will ſpeake in the firſt place) which he tooke from the contents of the oath, is the ſame, which hee touched before concerning the neceſſarie deduction, according to his beliefe and doctrine, of the <hi>Popes</hi> power to depoſe Princes from his Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Supremacie: But his beliefe and doctrine herein, as alſo I touched before, is not Catholike, but a particular beliefe, or rather opinion of himſelfe and ſome other, and not generall of all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, for that many learned Catholikes, as I ſhewed before, are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that <hi>Christ</hi> hath not giuen to S. <hi>Peter</hi> or to the Church, authoritie to depoſe Princes, or to inflict temporall puniſhments, as death, exile, priuation of goods, or impriſonment, but onely Eccleſiaſticall or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Cenſures. And therefore there is a great diſparitie in the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, which my <hi>Aduerſarie</hi> bringeth betwixt his <hi>Maieſties</hi> authoritie to ſuſpend, or depriue the <hi>Arch-biſhop</hi> of <hi>Canterburie</hi> in the opinion of Proteſtants, and the <hi>Popes</hi> power to depoſe Princes in the opinion of Catholikes, for that al Proteſtants do beleeue, that his <hi>Maieſties</hi> power to ſuſpend or depriue an <hi>Arch-biſhop</hi> (taking ſuſpenſion in that ſenſe, wherein the Proteſtants doe hold, that his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> hath power to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend and depriue) is neceſſarily included in his Regall authoritie, but all Catholikes doe not beleeue, (whatſoeuer my <hi>Aduerſary</hi> and ſome few others doe) that the power to depoſe Princes is neceſſarily inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in that ſpirituall Supremacie, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath giuen to S. <hi>Peter</hi> and his Succeſſours, as hath bene amply prooued by me and diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and what particulars M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> hath laide here, or in his <hi>Supplement</hi> concerning this point, we will beneath in their due places examine.</p>
            <p n="34">34 His <hi>first</hi> reaſon he deduced from the grounds and principles of the Proteſtants Religion, and from the doctrine and beliefe of his <hi>Maieſty,</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> who made the oath. But how ſilly and inſufficient this reaſon is, yea and repugnant to his owne grounds, and alſo of Fa. <hi>Parſons,</hi> in whoſe defence hee wrote his <hi>Supplement,</hi> any man of iudgement may quickly perceiue. For behold his reaſon: <hi>It is great reaſon,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>to interprete all aſſertions, poſitions, lawes or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees (eſpecially ſuch as touch Religion) according to the doctrine, and beliefe of the Authours thereof, for it is to be preſumed, that euery one ſpeaketh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

For which reaſon the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> doe holde, that although the <hi>Protestant Biſhops</hi> of this Realme haue Eccleſiaſticall and Epiſcopall authoritie herein England, yet they haue no authoritie by vertue of their Epiſcopall power to depoſe or depriue his <hi>Maiestie</hi> of his tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall dominions, for that <hi>they take depoſition, or any ſuch temporall violence,</hi> as his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> affirmeth,<note n="u" place="margin">In his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition.</hi> pag. <hi>9.</hi>

And therefore, <hi>as the poſitions, aſſertions, and decrees of knowen, and profeſſed Catholikes, are to be interpreted according to the grounds of the Catholike faith,</hi> vnleſſe they declare to haue a contrary meaning; <hi>ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the poſitions of all Sectaries are to be vnderstood according to the different doctrines of their Sects,</hi> vnleſſe they declare their meaning to bee other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: <hi>in ſo much that if a Catholike, and a Protestant ſhould affirme both of them one thing, which might be controuerſed in reſpect of Religion, the ſenſe and meaning of either of them is to bee interpreted according to their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Religions,</hi> vnleſſe they declare the contrary. And in this ſenſe my <hi>Aduerſaries Maior</hi> propoſition is true, otherwiſe it is falſe; for doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and ambiguous wordes are euer to bee vnderſtood according to the declaration of the ſpeaker, and the wordes of euery law, whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they are doubtfull, are to bee taken in that ſenſe, which the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker ſhall declare his meaning to be.</p>
            <p n="40">40 Now his <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> who with the <hi>Parliament</hi> deuiſed this new oath, not for the Proteſtants, but <hi>to make a triall how his Catholike ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects ſtand affected towards him in point of their loyaltie and due obedience,</hi> hath oftentimes, as my <hi>Aduerſary</hi> could not but ſee in my <hi>Theologicall Diſputation,</hi> publikely declared his meaning,<note n="b" place="margin">In an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> anno ſeptimo ca. <hi>6.</hi> and in his <hi>Premonition</hi> pag. <hi>9.</hi> and in his Apologie pag. <hi>2.</hi> nu. <hi>2.</hi> &amp; pag. <hi>246.</hi>

               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:150436:27"/>
And therefore his Maieſtie <hi>cauſed the lower houſe of Parliament to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that clauſe, which contained the deniall of the</hi> Popes <hi>power to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate him. So carefull was hee that nothing ſhould bee contained in this</hi> Oath, <hi>except the profeſſion of naturall allegiance, and ciuill and temporall obedience.</hi> Hee ſaide <hi>[in this oath] for as the oath of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie,</hi> ſaith his <hi>Maieſtie, was deuiſed for putting a difference betweene Papiſts, and them of our profeſſion, ſo was this oath ordained for making a difference betweene the ciuilly obedient Papists, and the peruerſe diſciples of the Powder-Treaſon.</hi> And againe, <hi>This oath,</hi> ſaith his <hi>Maieſtie, was ordained only for making of a true diſtinction betweene Papiſts of quiet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and in all other things good Subiects and ſuch other Papiſts, as in their hearts maintained the like violent bloodie maximes, that the Powder-Traitors did.</hi> The ſame alſo but in more ample wordes affirmeth his <hi>Maiestie</hi> in his <hi>Apologie</hi> for the oath.</p>
            <p n="41">41 Seeing therefore that his <hi>Maiestie</hi> hath ſo often, and ſo pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely declared, that he intended by this oath nothing elſe, but to make a true diſtinction, not betwixt Catholikes and Proteſtants, but betwixt Catholikes and Catholikes, and to vrge them only to make a profeſſion of that naturall and ciuill obedience, which all Subiects, of what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſoeuer they bee, doe by the law of God owe to their lawfull Prince, there is no reaſon to draw an argument from his <hi>Maiesties</hi> intention or beliefe, and from the grounds and principles of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants Religion, but only from the contents of the oath it ſelfe, to proue it to be vnlawfull, and to containe in it any thing which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to Catholike faith and Religion. And that this is a probable anſwere, and not a vaine bragge, and idle affirmation of my owne, it is ſo euident, that I dare aduenture to remit it to the iudgement of my <hi>Aduerſarie</hi> himſelfe, albeit he ſticketh not at this time to affirme, <hi>that I haue</hi> neither anſwered probably, nor like a good Catholike.</p>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:150436:28"/>
not only impudent, but alſo impious in preferring the declaration of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Prince (which neuertheleſſe being well weighed, doeth nothing helpe his cauſe, or preiudice ours) before an Apoſtolicall decree of S.</hi> Peters <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour, whoſe obedient child hee profeſſeth and ought to be, wherein he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſufficiently how good a Catholike he is, and whom he holdeth for his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame head in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, as alſo what probabilitie we may expect of him hereafter for the confirmation of the reſt of his aſſertions, ſeeing that wee haue found him at the very firſt ſo fraudulent, friuolous, and contrarie to his owne profeſſion, as you haue heard in this Chapter.</hi> Thus you ſee with what bitterneſſe M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> concludeth his <hi>firſt</hi> Chapter.</p>
            <p n="43">43 But if hee had beene pleaſed to haue dealt vprightly, and as hee hath in a moſt ſpitefull manner vrged againſt me this obiection, which is taken from his <hi>Holineſſe Breues,</hi> ſo alſo he had ſet downe the anſwere which in the <hi>tenth</hi> Chapter of my <hi>Theologicall Diſputation</hi> I gaue thereunto, the Reader would preſently haue perceiued, that my <hi>Aduerſarie</hi> hath paſſed the bounds of Chriſtian charitie and iuſtice in wrongfully accuſing me of impudencie, impietie, and diſobedience to the <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> decree of <hi>S.

            <p n="44">44 <hi>Firſt</hi> therefore I ſhewed in that place out of the doctrine of Fa. <hi>Suarez,</hi> that there are two ſorts of humane precepts, as well Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall, as Ciuill. The <hi>one</hi> is called a <hi>conſtitutiue</hi> precept, which of it ſelfe maketh that thing, which it forbiddeth to bee vnlawfull, which otherwiſe if that precept were not, would not bee vnlawfull: as the eating of fleſh in Lent, and the doing of ſeruile workes vpon Sundaies, and Holidayes, which if they were not forbidden by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane lawes, would not be vnlawfull. And although a <hi>conſtitutiue</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of humane power may ſometimes binde with danger of ſome great temporall loſſe, as of goods, libertie, yea alſo of life, yet the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall law, ſetting aſide ſcandall and contempt, which are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by the law of God, and nature, doe ſeldome or neuer binde with very great temporall harme: and therefore wee are not bound to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from fleſh in Lent, or from doing ſeruile workes vpon Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:150436:28"/>
and holidaies, when we are like to incurre thereby any probable danger of ſome great temporall hurt.</p>
            <p n="45">45 The <hi>other</hi> is called a <hi>declaratiue</hi> precept, which doth not of it ſelfe make, but ſuppoſe and declare the thing, which it forbiddeth to be vnlawfull, as being before prohibited by ſome other former law, as theft, murder, drunkenneſſe and ſuch like, which are otherwiſe forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by the law of God and nature. And this kind of precept, as well obſerueth <hi>Suarex,</hi> dependeth onely vpon the reaſon, for which the act is commanded, or forbidden, or, which is all one, vpon the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent law, from whence all the obligation of the <hi>declaratiue</hi> precept doth proceed. Inſomuch that if the reaſon be not true, and that there is no ſuch precedent law, or obligation, as the <hi>declaratiue</hi> precept affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be, the <hi>declaratiue</hi> precept hath no force to binde at all: and with the ſame certaintie, or probabilitie we are bound, or not bound to obey a <hi>declaratiue</hi> precept, as it is certaine or probable, that there is, or is not any other former bond and obligation.</p>
            <p n="46">46 As for example, his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> doth by his <hi>Breues</hi> forbidde all Engliſh Catholikes to take the new oath of allegiance, for that therein are contained many things, which are cleerely repugnant to faith and ſaluation. If therefore it be certaine, or probable, that nothing is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this oath which is repugnant to faith, or ſaluation, it is alſo certaine or probable, that this <hi>declaratiue</hi> precept of his <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> which is grounded vpon this reaſon, that ſomething is contained therein contrary to faith and ſaluation, is, according to the doctrine of <hi>Suarez,</hi> of no force to bind, neither are Engliſh Catholikes by vertue of this <hi>declaratiue</hi> prohibition bound to refuſe the ſaid oath.</p>
            <p n="47">47 Secondly, I alſo ſhewed in that place, that this <hi>declaratiue</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> forbidding Catholikes to take the oath, for that it containeth many things flat contrary to faith and ſaluation, is ſuch a <hi>declaratiue</hi> precept, which is not grounded vpon any infallible reaſon, or definition of the Church, but onely vpon his opinatiue iudgement, that his reaſon is true, and that either his power to <hi>excommunicate,</hi> and conſequently his ſpirituall Supremacie is denyed in this oath, which is very vntrue, or that his power to depoſe Princes, which is denyed in the oath, is a cleere point of faith, and neceſſarily included in his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Supremacie, and conſequently the denyall thereof is plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to Catholike faith. Which being ſo, it is manifeſt, that wee are no further bound to obey this <hi>declaratiue</hi> prohibition of his <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> then we are bound to follow his opinion, and to belieue, that ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his power to <hi>excommunicate,</hi> or ſome ſuch like is denyed in the oath, or that whoſoeuer denyeth his power to depoſe Princes, denyeth the Catholike faith.</p>
            <p n="48">48 Whereupon I concluded, that conſidering neither his power
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:150436:29"/>
to <hi>excommunicate,</hi> or any ſuch like is denyed in this oath, as I haue prooued at large againſt Card. <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and others, nor that his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to depoſe Princes, which is expreſſely denyed in the oath, is certaine and of faith, the contrary doctrine being probable and alſo maintained by many learned Catholikes, as partly alſo I haue already prooued by the teſtimonie of learned Catholikes before alledged, and heere beneath by anſwering all my <hi>Aduerſaries</hi> obiections I will make it more manifeſt,<note place="margin">Part. <hi>1.</hi> per. t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</note> there can bee made no doubt, but that any En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Catholike may with a ſafe conſcience, or without any crime of diſobedience to his ſupreme ſpirituall Paſtour, or any preiudice to Catholike faith, refuſe to obey his <hi>Holineſſe declaratiue</hi> command which is onely grounded vpon ſuch an opinion, which, conſidering the contrary is probable, and defended by many learned Catholikes, may without any note of impudencie, impiety or diſobedience be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected by Catholikes.</p>
            <p n="49">49 <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I alſo affirmed in that place, that no Catholike doth onely for this cauſe take the oath, or thinke it to be lawfull, becauſe the <hi>Kings Maiestie,</hi> being of a contrarie Religion doth command it, or thinke it to be lawfull, as though thoſe Catholikes, who take the oath, doe it onely vpon the <hi>Kings</hi> bare word affirming the oath to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and ſeeme thereby to preferre the opinion of a Proteſtant Prince in things, which in ſome ſort doe belong to Religion, before the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of our ſupreme ſpirituall Paſtour, but becauſe the <hi>Kings Maieſtie</hi> being our lawfull Prince, and Soueraigne Lord in temporals, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſoeuer hee profeſſeth, hath eſtabliſhed an oath of allegiance to make a triall how his Catholike ſubiects ſtand affected towards him in point of their loyaltie and due obedience, and commanded all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes to take the ſame, which oath learned Catholikes for probable reaſons doe thinke to be truely in oath of temporall allegiance, and to containe nothing which is repugnant to faith and ſaluation, therefore Engliſh Catholikes to obey the iuſt command of their Prince doe take the oath, and thinke it to be lawfull, both for that they hauing duely examined all the clauſes of the oath, doe find nothing therein contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to faith and ſaluation, and alſo for that many learned Catholikes, whoſe opinion they may lawfully follow, albeit other Diuines with the <hi>Popes Holineſſe</hi> doe thinke otherwiſe, doe conſtantly maintaine the ſame.</p>
            <p n="50">50 Neither doe I giue more credite to his <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> then to his <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> but both of them with all dutifull reſpect I doe honour, and alſo beleeue in thoſe things, which they of their certaine knowledge doe affirme to be true: And therefore, as I beleeue his <hi>Maieſties</hi> Royall word affirming, that his intention was not by this new oath of allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to deny the <hi>Popes</hi> power to <hi>excommunicate;</hi> ſo alſo I beleeue, that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:150436:29"/>
firſt <hi>Breue</hi> of his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> was not ſurreptitious and written without his knowledge or priuitie, for that in his ſecond <hi>Breue</hi> he doth auerre as much. But as for the firſt <hi>Breue,</hi> wherein Engliſh Catholikes are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded not to take the oath, for that it containeth many things flat contrary to faith and ſaluation, it being, as I ſaide, onely a <hi>declaratiue</hi> precept, and grounded vpon a fallible, and in my iudgement, a very falſe opinion, that either the <hi>Popes</hi> power to <hi>excommunicate</hi> is denied in the oath, or that it is a point of faith, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath power so depoſe Princes, it is euident, according to <hi>Suarez</hi> doctrine, that no Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike is bound to obey this his <hi>declaratiue</hi> precept, vnleſſe hee be alſo bound either to beleeue, that the <hi>Popes</hi> power to <hi>excommunicate</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied in the oath, which is apparently vntrue, or to follow his opinion concerning the certainety of his power to depoſe, which being in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie among Schoolemen, and learned Doctours, and as yet not decided by the Iudge, as no man is bound according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon doctrine of <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> and many others, to follow it, ſo alſo no man is bound, according to the approued doctrine of <hi>Suarez,</hi> to obey his <hi>declaratiue</hi> precept, which is grounded thereon.</p>
            <p n="51">51 <hi>Laſtly,</hi> I obſerued in that place, that if his <hi>Maiestie</hi> ſhould by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> commaund all his Catholike ſubiects to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by oath, that the <hi>Pope</hi> is not by the inſtitution of Chriſt the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect temporall Lord of this Kingdome, or of any other, and that hee hath no direct power to depoſe his <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> and that they will beare faith and true allegiance onely to his <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> as to their direct Lord, and Soueraigne, &amp;c. and his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> following the Canoniſts opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on who hold it hereticall to affirme, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath not direct do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion ouer the whole Chriſtian world, ſhould by his Apoſtolicall <hi>Breues,</hi> forbid all Engliſh Catholikes to take ſuch an oath, for that it containeth (as the Canoniſts imagine) many things contrary to faith and ſaluation, (as <hi>Pope Sixtus</hi> the fifth, if any credit may bee giuen to the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> themſelues did intend to condenme, if he had liued, Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> his firſt tome of controuerſies for impugning the <hi>Popes</hi> direct dominion in temporals) the very ſame inuectiue, which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> maketh againſt mee, accuſing me of impudencie, impietie, diſobedience, and of being no good Catholike, for not obeying the <hi>Popes declaratiue</hi> precept, which is only grounded vpon ſuch an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which no Catholike is bound to follow, for that the contrary is maintained by many learned Diuines, hee might alſo make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all thoſe Catholikes, who following heerein Cardinall <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> and the common doctrine of Diuines, ſhould take that oath, and thinke it to bee lawfull, notwithſtanding the <hi>Popes declaratiue</hi> precept to the contrary.

in the like manner as I haue cleered my ſelfe, defend thoſe Catholikes from all imputation of impudency, impietie, diſobedience, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther crime, notwithſtanding the <hi>Popes declaratiue</hi> precept to the contrarie.</p>
            <p n="52">52 Thus did I anſwere to this obiection taken from his <hi>Holineſſe Breues,</hi> but more amply in my <hi>Theologicall Diſputation,</hi> ſhewing alſo by ſundry examples, that diuers <hi>Popes</hi> haue in their <hi>Apostolicall Breues,</hi> or decretall letters regiſtred in the Canon law, maintained falſe opinions, and which now are flat hereticall, and that therefore their opinions, and conſequently their <hi>declaratiue</hi> precepts grounded thereon, are not alwaies to bee followed by Catholikes, and withal, that many learned Diuines haue impugned diuers decrees of <hi>Popes</hi> concerning the licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which they haue giuen to Prieſts to miniſter the Sacrament of Confirmation, and their diſpenſations in the ſolemne vow of religious chaſtitie, and in marriage not conſummate, who were not therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted impudent, impious, or diſobedient children of the Catholike Church, for that ſuch decrees were not grounded vpon any infallible definition, but onely vpon the <hi>Popes</hi> fallible opinion, which they of ſet purpoſe did impugne,<note place="margin">Sot. in. <hi>4.</hi> diſt. <hi>27.</hi> q. <hi>1.</hi> ar. <hi>4.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y <hi>Aduerſarie</hi> in this Chapter goeth on with the like bitterneſſe as he did in the former, and as before hee taxed me of <hi>fraude, impudencie, impietie, and of being no good Catholike,</hi> but how wrongfully you haue alreadie ſeene, ſo now he boldly affirmeth, that my arguments, and anſweres are partly <hi>repugnant to my owne doctrine,</hi> and partly <hi>malicious, improbable, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, fooliſh</hi> and <hi>ridiculous,</hi> but how vndeſeruedly you ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently perceiue. He tooke vpon him, as you haue ſeene, to proue in his <hi>Supplement,</hi> that the oath is vnlawfull, and repugnant to all lawes humane and diuine, in reſpect of <hi>two</hi> clauſes, to wit, that it doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt temporall Princes from <hi>Excommunication,</hi> and depoſition by the <hi>Pope,</hi> and that therefore it was iuſtly condemned by his <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> and refuſed by Catholikes, although for this <hi>later</hi> hee could not bee igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that where one Catholike hath refuſed it, a hundred haue taken it.

            <p n="2">2 But as for the <hi>ſecond</hi> clauſe concerning the <hi>Popes</hi> power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Princes, which is expreſly denied in the oath, he maketh a long Rhetoricall diſcourſe, labouring in vaine to prooue, that according to all lawes humane and diuine the <hi>Pope</hi> hath power to depoſe Princes and to diſpoſe of all their temporals. And becauſe the breuitie of that <hi>Admonition,</hi> which was made after my <hi>Theologicall Diſputation</hi> was in the preſſe, would not permit to examine in particular all the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which he brought to prooue the ſame, I thought good to

anſwere briefly ſuch arguments, as ſeemed moſt plauſible, and withall to inſinuate a certaine diſtinction, which I had oftentimes in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer bookes declared more at large, betweene the <hi>Popes</hi> power to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> temporals, and to <hi>diſpoſe</hi> of temporals, to <hi>command</hi> or <hi>impoſe</hi> temporall penalties, and to <hi>inflict</hi> temporall penalties, or to puniſh tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally by way of <hi>coercion,</hi> which diſtinction doth plainly declare the true ſtate of the queſtion, which he ſeeketh to obſcure, and quite ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth all his chiefeſt grounds.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Among the reſt of his proofes he brought one from this vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar rule of the law, <hi>Acceſſorium ſequitur principale, The acceſſorie follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the principall,</hi> from whence hee inferred,<note n="a" place="margin">Cap. <hi>1.</hi> Suppl. nu. <hi>67.</hi>

For whereas to cleere the vnderſtanding of his Reader, he ſhould haue declared of what power he meant, for that I granted the conſequence, if it were vnderſtood of the power to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> temporals, but if it were vnderſtood of the power to <hi>diſpoſe</hi> of temporals, in which ſenſe he muſt needs vnderſtood it, if be will ſpeake to purpoſe, then I denyed his conſequence, yet he onely affirmeth, <hi>that he doth not thereby ſuppoſe in the</hi> Pope <hi>any other power ouer bodies, or goods, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch as followeth from the ſubordination to the ſoule, which is in effect the ſame relation and limitation that</hi> Widdrington <hi>maketh thereof, to wit, ſo farre forth, as corporall and temporall things are to ſerue spirituall.</hi> But if he had expreſſed, that according to his doctrine and not mine, from the ſubordination and relation of the ſoule to the body, and of temporall things to ſpirituall, it neceſſarily followeth, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath power not onely to <hi>command</hi> or <hi>impoſe</hi> temporall things, but alſo to <hi>diſpoſe</hi> of temporall things, not onely to enioyne temporall penalties, but alſo to puniſh temporally by depriuing men of their temporals, the Reader would preſently haue perceiued both the weakeneſſe of his argument, and the ſufficiencie of my anſwere.</p>
            <p n="9">9 For it is very apparant, and my <hi>Aduerſary</hi> knoweth it right well, that I alwaies denied, that either from the ſubordination, ſubiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or relation of temporall things to ſpirituall things, of temporall ends to ſpirituall ends, of temporall power to ſpirituall power, of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Princes to ſpirituall Paſtours, or from any other ground, rule, or principle, it doth neceſſarily follow, that the <hi>Pope</hi> as <hi>Pope,</hi> and by his Paſtorall office, hath power to diſpoſe of temporall things, to depoſe temporall Princes, to inflict temporall puniſhments, or which is all one, to puniſh temporally by way of temporall conſtraint, as by depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

And therefore with good reaſon, and conformably to my owne doctrine I graunted the conſequence, if it were vnderſtood of the power to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> temporals, and alſo denied it, if it were vnderſtood, as my <hi>Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie</hi> muſt needes vnderſtand it, of the power to <hi>diſpoſe</hi> of temporals, and to puniſh temporally by way of temporall conſtraint.

            <p n="11">11 But how weake, and altogether inſufficient is this Diſcourſe of his, to prooue the <hi>Popes</hi> power to depoſe temporall Princes, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of all their temporals, and to puniſh temporally by way of <hi>coerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> which is the maine marke, at which my <hi>Aduerſary</hi> aymeth, any man of indifferent vnderſtanding and learning may eaſily perceiue.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:150436:33"/>
For <hi>first,</hi> although it be true, that the ſpirituall Paſtour hath that ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall power, ouer the ſoule and body, which for as much as appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the power it ſelfe, and not in regard of all other things, which are requiſite, that the power ſhall haue effect, is ſufficient and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the eternall ſaluation of ſoules, yet that hee muſt needes haue euen ouer the ſoule, and much leſſe ouer the body, and temporall goods, and ſtates all that power, which is conuenient for the good of ſoule, as my <hi>Aduerſary</hi> heere affirmeth, is very vntrue: for this were a too too large extenſion of the <hi>Popes</hi> paſtorall power ouer the ſoule and body, and would cleerely prooue, that the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould haue power to doe miracles, as the Apoſtles had, and by miraculous operations to bring actually all Chriſtians to the kingdome of heauen. For no man, as I thinke, can make doubt, but that the <hi>Pope</hi> to haue all that power, whereby all Chriſtians ſhall bee actually ſaued, is very conuenient for the good of ſoules. Neither will my <hi>Aduerſarie</hi> be euer able to prooue, that it is neceſſary to the ſaluation of ſoules, or to the gouernment of the Church, as it was inſtituted by <hi>Chriſt</hi> to bee a ſpirituall, and not a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Common-wealth, to haue power to diſpoſe of temporals, and to depriue temporall Princes of their kingdomes and liues.</p>
            <p n="12">12 <hi>Secondly,</hi> that propoſition, <hi>he that hath the greater power hath the leſſe,</hi> which my <hi>Aduerſary</hi> vntruely ſaith to bee a rule of the Law, for that it is not to bee found among the rules either of the Canon, or Ciuill Law, is very vntrue, if it bee taken in thoſe generall wordes, and without due limitations, which my <hi>Aduerſary</hi> doth not declare, as might be conuinced by infinite examples, whereof ſome may be ſeene in the next Chapter, where wee ſhall treate of this Maxime more at large: and for the preſent this onely ſhall ſuffice, that if it were vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally true, it would cleerely conuince, that the <hi>Pope,</hi> who by the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath ſpirituall power, which is the greater power, ſhould alſo haue temporall power, which is the leſſe, which my <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie,</hi> as I thinke, will hardly grant, vnleſſe hee will now become a <hi>Canonist,</hi> and affirme, that the <hi>Pope</hi> as <hi>Pope</hi> hath both temporall and ſpirituall power, and is both a temporall and ſpirituall Prince, which is repugnant to the common doctrine of the Diuines of his owne Societie.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="20">20 By which it is euident, that this manner of iudging, which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> commands, was not legall, or done by publike authoritie, and that theſe <hi>Iudges</hi> were not Magiſtrates, and who had publike au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. And therefore although theſe arbitrarie Iudges were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the <hi>declaratiue</hi> commandement of the <hi>Apostle</hi> for the auoyding of ſcandall, yet their power was only priuate and compromiſſorie, and was giuen them by the mutuall conſent of both parties, in ſo much, that if either of the parties who were in ſuite, would not haue obeyed the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> commandement, &amp; admitted of thoſe <hi>Arbiters,</hi> but would haue had recourſe to the tribunal of the Heathen Magiſtrate, although by diſobeying the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> commandement, and by ſcandalizing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion he ſhould haue greatly offended, yet he ſhould not haue offended againſt iuſtice, in wronging either of thoſe Chriſtian Iudges, or the other partie that would not willingly goe to the Heathen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, againſt which without doubt he ſhould haue offended, if hee had refuſed to obey the ſentence of his lawfull and legall <hi>Iudge,</hi> and who had full power and authoritie, to decide and end the cauſe.</p>
            <p n="21">21 And by this it is very cleere, that my <hi>Aduerſaries</hi> concluſion is very vntrue, to wit, <hi>that the</hi> Apoſtle <hi>did intermeddle in the temporall and politike gouernment, which then belonged to the Pagan Emperour,</hi> for this had bene to derogate from the ciuill ſubiection due to temporall Princes, but he did onely intermeddle with the priuate and peaceable compoſition of ſecular controuerſies among the faithfull <hi>Corinthians,</hi> which euery Chriſtian without any publike authoritie, or any preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to the ſame might doe, and which the <hi>Apostle</hi> by his Apoſtolicall and ſpirituall power might command the Chriſtians to doe, and by ſpirituall Cenſures compell them ſo to doe, when otherwiſe they ſhould ſcandalize the Chriſtian faith and religion. And this very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere did I giue in my <hi>Apologie</hi> to this text of holy Scripture, which was vrged by Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to prooue, that the <hi>Pope</hi> had power to depoſe and put downe Secular Princes, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> had power to appoint and ſet vp new Iudges in Secular cauſes: for I denyed his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, becauſe the appointing and ſetting vp of thoſe <hi>Iudges</hi> did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing derogate from the ſubiection due to Secular Princes, for that they were onely <hi>Arbiters,</hi> or peaceable compoſers of ſecular cauſes with the conſent of the parties who were at ſtrife, but the putting downe of <hi>Princes,</hi> or depriuing them of their Royall authoritie, doth greatly derogate, or rather quite ouerthrow and aboliſh their tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſoueraigntie.</p>
            <p n="22">

               </note> That <hi>although theſe Iudges whom the Apostle commanded the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to appoint, had not indeede</hi> vim coactiuam in foro externo, <hi>a coactiue power in the externall Court, and that if either partie would not obey the Apostle, and goe to the Iudges appointed by the Church, but would bring his cauſe to the publike tribunals of the heathen Magiſtrates, the other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie was bound there to appeare, and there to debate his cauſe, yet they were not meere Arbiters or voluntary Iudges: For Arbiters are choſen by the parties, but theſe were choſen by the common conſent of the Church, and were appointed by publike authoritie, by the command of the Apoſtle, who was a ſpirituall Prince. Beſides, none are bound to admit Arbiters, vnleſſe they will, but Christians were bound to admit theſe Iudges, and were forbidden to goe to the tribunals of Infidell Princes. Moreouer the Saints are not to iudge the world and Angels, as Arbiters choſen by them, but as true Iudges, and as ſitting with Chriſt the ſupreame Iudge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="23">23 But all this is eaſily ſatisfied by that which I ſaid before: For although the faithfull <hi>Corinthians</hi> were by the publike ſpirituall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> commaunded to chooſe thoſe <hi>Iudges,</hi> or <hi>Arbiters,</hi> yet it doth not from thence follow, either that thoſe arbitrarie <hi>Iudges</hi> were to bee choſen by the whole Church, and not onely by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that were at ſtrife, or that the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> for that he was a ſpirituall Prince, had either himſelfe publike authoritie to decide ſecular cauſes, or could giue the ſame to any other. But becauſe the Chriſtians were bound by the Law of God to compound their controuerſies among themſelues, by way of arbitriment, and not to bring their cauſes to the hearing of Heathen Iudges, in caſe they ſhould thereby ſcandalize the Chriſtian Religion, therefore the <hi>Apostle</hi> might by his publike ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and Paſtorall power <hi>command</hi> them, and alſo with <hi>ſpirituall</hi> Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures <hi>compell</hi> them ſo to doe.</p>
            <p n="24">24 And although theſe arbitrarie <hi>Iudges,</hi> were to be choſen by the whole Church, and by the common conſent of all the faithfull Corinthians, which neuertheleſſe can not bee ſufficiently gathered from the <hi>Apostles</hi> wordes, yet it doth not therefore follow, that they were not meere <hi>Arbiters,</hi> or voluntarie <hi>Iudges</hi> in power, or, which is all one that they had more then arbitrarie, priuate or compromiſſorie power. For it is not materiall by whom a publike, or legall Iudge, or elſe an <hi>Arbitratour,</hi> or compromiſſorie Iudge bee choſen, but from whom they receiue their authoritie to iudge: as a true, proper, and publike Iudge may ſometimes bee choſen by the people, as is the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corder</hi> of <hi>London</hi> by the Citie, and the <hi>Chancellours</hi> of <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> by the Vniuerſities, but it is the <hi>Kings Maiesty</hi> that giueth them publike authoritie to iudge: And <hi>Achiters,</hi> or voluntary Iudges may be choſen by the common conſent of the people to decide by way of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:150436:36"/>
arbitrement, or voluntarie ſubmiſſion all ciuill controuerſies, which ſhall ariſe among them, yet ſeeing that they are onely <hi>Arbiters,</hi> or haue onely arbitrarie, voluntarie, priuate, or compromiſſorie power, the parties onely who are at ſtrife doe giue power to iudge, and to make a finall end of their controuerſies. And although abſtracting from ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall none are bound to admit <hi>Arbiters,</hi> vnleſſe they will, yet if by not admitting them they ſhould ſcandalize the Chriſtian Religion, as the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did, they are bound to admit them, or which is all one, to giue them arbitrarie, voluntrary, or compromiſſorie power to decide and determine their controuerſies.</p>
            <p n="25">25 True alſo it is, that the Saints are not to iudge the world, or the bad Angels, as <hi>Arbiters,</hi> yet in what manner they are to iudge, whether by onely aſſiſting our Sauiour, and approouing or applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his ſentence, or by being <hi>Aſſeſſores ſupremi Iudicis Chriſti,</hi> by ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in ſeates of honour with Chriſt the ſupreme Iudge, as Noble men, and Iuſtices of peace do ſit vpon the bench, with the chiefe Iudge of Aſſiſes, or in any other more peculiar manner, it is a controuerſie among Catholike Diuines, although it be certaine, that the Saints ſhall not be true and proper Iudges, as Iudges are properly taken, howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> doth ſeeme heere to affirme the ſame, for that to iudge, and to giue iudgement, doth properly ſignifie an act of Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and ſuperiority of power to giue the definitiue ſentence <hi>pro,</hi> or <hi>contra,</hi> which Iuriſdiction in reſpect of the laſt iudgement of ſoules, is onely communicated to <hi>Christ.</hi>

conſequence which he impugneth, by drawing two other conſequences from the ſame principle, and confronting them with mine to ſhew ſome abſurdity therein.</hi>

            <p n="49">49 But M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> may alſo note, that I haue committed no abſurdity in denying abſolutely the conſequence, and alſo graunting it with a condition, for ſo I doe not graunt it in that ſenſe wherein I doe deny it.

               <hi>But of theſe two inſtances I must needes ſay, that the former is ridiculous, and the later malicious; for by the former hee impugneth himſelfe, and not mee: You haue heard him before admit my conſequence, ſo that it bee vnderſtood of power to command corporall things in order to ſpirituall; for he ſaith that my conſequence is vaine except it be vnderſtood in this manner, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being vnderstood ſo, hee alloweth it for good. And if we vnderſtand it ſo then it muſt needes follow according to his owne ground, that hee who is Lord of all horſes (which are the principall) may command all bridles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are the acceſſorie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="53">53 <hi>Now then hee must either grant his owne argument or deny it; if be grant it, hee prooueth nothing thereby againſt mee, but rather fortifieth my conſequence (which is, as hee himſelfe relateth it, that the Church ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing power ouer the ſoule, hath power alſo ouer the body and goods, becauſe the</hi> acceſſorie <hi>followeth the</hi> principall) <hi>If hee deny it, hee denieth his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer grant, which was, as you haue heard, that whoſoeuer hath power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the</hi> principall, <hi>may command the</hi> acceſſorie, <hi>for ſeeing that all hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are the</hi> principall, <hi>and all bridles the</hi> acceſſorie <hi>(according to his owne ſuppoſition in his argument) hee that denieth the Lord of all horſes to bee the Lord of all bridles, denieth that hee who hath power to command the</hi> principall <hi>may command the</hi> acceſſorie, <hi>which is the ſame that hee hath granted already, as you haue heard; ſo as I ſee not to what purpoſe this his argument ſerueth, but to diſcouer his owne folly, and yet forſooth hee will haue vs to beleeue in any caſe, that all his arguments are probable at least.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="54">54 But I muſt needes ſay, <hi>good Reader,</hi> that my <hi>Aduerſarie</hi> hath ſmall reaſon, for theſe two inſtances, which I brought againſt that rule, or maxime, <hi>The acceſſorie followeth the principall,</hi> as it was vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by him, to vſe ſuch vndecent tearmes, for whoſe folly is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, and who is the ridiculous and malicious, you ſhall foorth with perceiue. It is true, that I granted the conſequence not to be vaine, if it were only vnderſtood of a power in the <hi>Pope</hi> to command ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all things, and to puniſh temporally by way of command in order to ſpitituall good: but from hence it doeth not follow according to my ground, but according to his owne, that he who is Lord of all horſes, may conſequently command all bridles, yea and it followeth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his ground, that hee who can diſpoſe of all horſes, can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:150436:43"/>
of all bridles, and that hee who buyeth all horſes, doeth conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently buy all bridles: For <hi>firſt,</hi> by his conſequence hee doth intend not only to prooue, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath power to command tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things, or to puniſh temporally by way of command, but alſo to diſpoſe of temporalls, to depoſe temporall Princes, and to inflict tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall puniſhments, as I ſhewed before<note n="h" place="margin">

                  <hi>Nu.</hi> 13.14.15.16.</note>. <hi>Secondly,</hi> according alſo to his owne ground, and not mine, a bridle is <hi>acceſſorie</hi> to a horſe, for that it is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to ſerue a horſe, for which cauſe hee affirmeth, that temporall things are <hi>acceſſorie</hi> to ſpirituall things, for that they are ordained to ſerue ſpirituall things. And therefore according to his owne ground theſe conſequences are good: <hi>The acceſſorie followeth the principall, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he who is Lord of all horſes is Lord of all bridles,</hi> therefore <hi>hee who can command all horſes can command all bridles,</hi> therefore <hi>hee who can diſpoſe of all horſes can diſpoſe of all bridles,</hi> therefore <hi>hee who buyeth all horſes,</hi> which are the principall, <hi>muſt conſequently buy all bridles,</hi> which are the acceſſorie.</p>
            <p n="55">55 But I doe not graunt, that a bridle is <hi>acceſſorie,</hi> or <hi>conſequent</hi> to a horſe, or that corporall and temporall goods are <hi>acceſſorie</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent</hi> to the ſpirituall good of the ſoule, in that ſenſe as <hi>acceſſorie</hi> is and ought to be taken in that maxime, <hi>The acceſſorie or conſequent must follow the principall or antecedent,</hi> or which is all one, <hi>if the principall or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent be ſuppoſed or graunted, the acceſſorie or conſequent must of neceſſitie follow:</hi> and my reaſon is, for that a horſe can be without a bridle, and the ſpirituall good or life of the ſoule can be without corporall goods, or temporall honour and riches, yea and better without them, then with them.

intended nothing elſe then this, I ſhould indeed haue prooued nothing againſt him, but ſhould haue fortified his conſequence; But becauſe in his conſequence he ſpake of a power in the Church in generall ouer the ſoule, body and goods, <hi>therefore the Church,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>hauing power ouer the ſoule, hath power conſequently ouer the body and goods,</hi> which power may be vnderſtood not onely of a power to command, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to diſpoſe, not onely to enioyne ſpirituall and temporall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but alſo to inflict them, and becauſe the <hi>Pope</hi> in order to ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall good hath a power not only to command ſpirituall puniſhments, but alſo to inflict them, and by a iuridicall ſentence to depriue men of certaine ſpirituall goods and benefites, therefore by his conſequence it might ſeeme to be rightly inferred, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath alſo in order to ſpirituall good a power to diſpoſe of the bodie and of temporall goods, euen as temporall Princes haue in order to temporall good a power not onely to command, but alſo to diſpoſe thereof, and to depriue by a iuridicall ſentence their ſubiects of their temporall goods, and alſo of their corporall liues, and becauſe my <hi>Aduerſaries</hi> drift and meaning was to prooue thus much by his conſequence, therefore in this ſenſe, which his words did beare, and he alſo intend, I did abſolutely denye his conſequence.

            <p n="59">59 Wherefore, according to my opinion, who doe not make bridles to be <hi>acceſſory</hi> to horſes in that ſenſe, as <hi>acceſſory</hi> is taken in that maxime, but a ſupreme power to diſpoſe of all bridles to bee <hi>acceſſory,</hi> or <hi>conſequent</hi> to a ſupreme power to diſpoſe of all horſes, for that a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power to diſpoſe both of horſes and bridles, is neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in a ſupreme power to diſpoſe of all temporall things, as a part in the whole, the aforeſaid argument, ſpeaking of a ſupreme temporall Prince is good, not onely <hi>vi conſequentis</hi> (to vſe the termes of Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians) <hi>by vertue of the conſequent,</hi> but alſo <hi>vi conſequentiae, by vertue of the conſequence,</hi> or, which is all one, not onely the conſequent is true, but alſo the conſequence is good.

               <hi>alſo</hi> Widdringtons <hi>argument euen in particular and priuate men, it may haue a very true ſenſe, and will fortifie mine; for whoſoeuer is Lord of any horſe, is Lord alſo of the bridles that belong to that horſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (according to</hi> Widdringtons <hi>ſuppoſition) they are</hi> acceſſory <hi>of the ſaid horſe, and therefore according to my axiome, doe follow their</hi> principall: <hi>and the ſame must needes bee granted in this our caſe, ſeeing that the</hi> Pope <hi>doth no otherwiſe dispoſe of temporall goods then the ſame doe belong to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men, whom he hath occaſion to chaſtiſe for the benefit of their ſoules, and the publike good of the Church; and therefore when he puniſheth any Prince temporally, hee neither doth, nor can doe it in other mens goods, but onely in thoſe goods, or ſtates, which belong to that Prince, as a Lord of a horſe diſpoſeth not of other mens bridles, but of the bridles that belong to his owne horſe; for as other mens bridles are not</hi> acceſſory <hi>of that horſe, ſo neither are other mens goods</hi> acceſſory <hi>to the Prince, who is to be puniſhed, but ſuch goods or ſtates onely as belong to him, and may conſequently be diſpoſed of by his ſupreme Pastour, when his and the publike good of the Church ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily require it: So as you ſee how well</hi> Widdrington <hi>argueth for mee, and therefore the probabilitie that I ſee in this his argument, is no other, but that he playeth, as I may ſay, booty with me, and helpeth vnder hand to defend my cauſe. Thus much for the first argument.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="62">62 But <hi>first</hi> it is vntrue, that I according to my owne doctrine doe ſuppoſe that bridles are <hi>acceſſory</hi> to horſes, as <hi>acceſſory</hi> is taken in the aforeſaid maxime, but I doe ſuppoſe, and that truely, according to my <hi>Aduerſaries</hi> doctrine, that bridles are <hi>acceſſory</hi> to horſes, for that they are made and ordained for horſes, in which ſenſe hee taketh <hi>acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorie</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="63">63 <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is alſo vntrue, that the argument, which I made againſt his conſequence, if it be conſidered in particular and priuate men, can haue a very true ſenſe, as it is grounded in that rule or maxime, <hi>the acceſſory followeth the principall,</hi> and that it doth fortifie his conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. <hi>For whoſoeuer,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is Lord of any horſe, is Lord alſo of the bridles that belong to that horſe, becauſe</hi> (according to his owne ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not mine) <hi>they are the acceſſory of the ſaide horſe.</hi> Obſerue now, good <hi>Reader,</hi> how cunningly this man would ſhift off the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or inſtance, which I made againſt his conſequence, and delude thee with ambiguous words. For what can any man imagine my <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſary</hi> to vnderſtand by theſe wordes <hi>[the bridles that belong to that horſe]</hi> for ſurely no man can be ſo ſimple, as to thinke, that any bridle can be ſaid to belong to a horſe, as to the true owner thereof, or ſo proper to a horſe, that the horſe can not be without that bridle, for ſo indeede it would very well follow from that maxime, that he, who is Lord of that horſe, is alſo Lord of that bridle, and he that ſhould buy that horſe, ſhould alſo buy that bridle which belongeth to that horſe. And therefore either it muſt be ſaid, that ſuch a bridle doth belong to ſuch a horſe for that the bridlemaker did make it ſerue ſuch a horſe, and for this reſpect it can not be truely ſaid, that he, who is Lord of that horſe, is Lord alſo of that bridle, for the bridlemaker, and not he who is owner of that horſe, may be Lord and owner of the bridle: or elſe for that ſuch a bridle is, for the moſt part, or alwaies vſed for ſuch a horſe; neither for this reſpect, or any ſuch like can it be truly ſaid, that he who is Lord of that horſe is conſequently Lord of that bridle, and can diſpoſe thereof, becauſe that bridle may be lent for the vſe of that horſe by ſome other man, who is the true Lord and owner of that bridle, and conſequently may diſpoſe thereof, and not of the horſe.</p>
            <p n="64">64 It remaineth therefore, that for this cauſe onely, as my <hi>Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary</hi> himſelfe here inſinuateth, ſuch a bridle can bee ſaid to belong to ſuch a horſe, for that the ſame man, who is the true Lord, and owner both of the horſe and bridle, and conſequently hath power to diſpoſe of them both, doth appoint that bridle to ſerue that horſe; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in this ſenſe that conſequent bee true, to wit, that hee who is Lord of any horſe, is alſo Lord, and can diſpoſe of the bridles, which belong to ſuch a horſe, or to ſpeake more properly, which belong to the Lord of ſuch a horſe, for that the ſame man is Lord of them both, yet it is not true by vertue of the <hi>conſequence,</hi> or by vertue of that maxime, <hi>The acceſſory followeth the principall,</hi> or for that the horſe is the <hi>principall,</hi> and the bridle the <hi>acceſſorie,</hi> in that ſenſe as <hi>principall</hi> and <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſorie</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:150436:45"/>
ought to be taken in that maxime, for then it muſt alſo follow, that hee who buyeth that horſe, and conſequently can diſpoſe thereof, as being the true owner of that horſe, hath alſo power to diſpoſe of that bridle, for that the <hi>acceſſorie muſt follow the principall,</hi> which conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is falſe, but the conſequent is true not by vertue of that maxime, <hi>The acceſſorie followeth the principall,</hi> but by vertue of another maxime, which is, that <hi>he who is the true Lord, or owner of any horſe, bridle, or of any ſuch like temporall thing hath power to diſpoſe thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="65">65 Wherefore it is apparant, that my aforeſaid inſtance, argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or conſequence, <hi>The acceſſorie followeth the principall, therefore hee who is Lord of all horſes, is conſequently Lord, and can diſpoſe of all bridles,</hi> is neither true in Soueraigne Princes, nor in priuate men, vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as my <hi>Aduerſarie</hi> doth, that bridles are <hi>acceſſorie</hi> to horſes, neither doth that conſequent, although it bee true, not by vertue of that maxime, <hi>The acceſſorie followeth the principall,</hi> but by vertue of this, that <hi>hee who is Lord of any bridle hath power to diſpoſe thereof,</hi> or <hi>he that is Lord and can diſpoſe of all temporall things, hath conſequently power to dispoſe both of all horſes, and all bridles,</hi> fortifie my <hi>Aduerſaries</hi> argument concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Popes</hi> power to diſpoſe of all temporall things, vnleſſe it bee firſt prooued, as hitherto it hath not beene, that the <hi>Pope</hi> is Lord both in temporalls and ſpiritualls, in ſuch ſort, that for the common ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all good hee may diſpoſe of all temporall things, as it is certaine, that abſolute Princes may for the common temporall good diſpoſe of all temporalls, and priuate men may diſpoſe of thoſe goods, which are their owne. And therefore the compariſon, which my <hi>Aduerſarie</hi> heere maketh, betwixt the Lord of a horſe, who only diſpoſeth of his owne bridles, and not of another mans, and the <hi>Pope,</hi> who to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh a Prince diſpoſeth only of the Princes goods and ſtates, and not of other mens, is to little purpoſe, for that it doth ſuppoſe that which is in queſtion, and which hitherto hee hath not prooued, to wit, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath power to diſpoſe of the temporall goods, ſtates, and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of all Chriſtians, and that the publike good of the Church doth neceſſarily require, that the <hi>Pope</hi> haue power to diſpoſe of all tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls.

power to take away the liues of Chriſtian Princes and ſubiects) <hi>and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on iuſt occaſion giuen by him:</hi> and againe, <hi>that the</hi> Pope <hi>hath power ouer the temporall goods, states and bodies of all Chriſtians,</hi> (and conſequently of Chriſtian Princes) <hi>when the good of ſoules, and of the whole Church doth neceſſarily require it.</hi> So that you ſee he graunteth my argument to be good, but yet to be malicious, that I ſpeake the trueth, but of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice. But truely it is ſtrange to what virulent and ſlanderous ſpeeches ſome intemperate ſpirit hath drawen the libertie of this mans pen. If he imagine, that with any colourable reply he can except againſt my aunſwere, then it is friuolous, impertinent, fooliſh and ridiculous: if he can not, then it is malicious. God almightie, who is the onely ſearcher of all mens hearts, knoweth herein my innocencie, and that zeale to the Catholike religion, deſire to know the trueth, loue to my Prince and countrey, and not any ſplene or malice hath mooued me to write both this, and all the reſt: and therefore I humbly beſeech his Diuine <hi>Maieſtie</hi> to forgiue him, and to graunt him true repentance for that which is paſt, and that hereafter he may haue a more milde and temperate ſpirit.</p>
            <p n="70">70 But wherefore, trow you, is my argument malicious? <hi>becauſe it draweth him,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>to an odious queſtion:</hi> as though, forſooth, the propounding of euery odious argument, although it be neuer ſo good and conuincing, muſt needs proceed from malice. I confeſſe indeed, that this doctrine concerning the killing of Chriſtian Princes is odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, abominable, falſe, ſcandalous, neuer taught in the Church of God before theſe later yeeres; and which all good ſubiects ought with all their hearts to deteſt and abhorre, and Princes more narrowly to looke vnto, and whether this doctrine for the <hi>Popes</hi> power to depoſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes be a point of faith, from whence ſuch an odious, ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and deteſtable doctrine doth neceſſarily follow, I hope all good Catholikes, and true hearted ſubiects will heereafter more diligently conſider.</p>
            <p n="71">71 <hi>And how true it is,</hi> ſayth my Aduerſarie, <hi>that the</hi> Pope <hi>hath power ouer the life of any Chriſtian (with the circumſtances and limitations before mentioned) I feare me, my Aduerſarie</hi> Widdrington <hi>might finde to his cost, if he were here at Rome, and would not recant his doctrine euen in this point, to wit, that the Church can not inflict corporall and temporall puniſhment, whereby he impugneth</hi> &amp;c. But <hi>first,</hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath power at <hi>Rome</hi> ouer the liues of thoſe who are his temporall ſubiects, no man calleth in queſtion, for that he is now the temporall Prince of <hi>Rome.</hi> But this prooueth not, that the <hi>Pope</hi> as he is <hi>Pope,</hi> and by vertue of his ſpirituall power hath authoritie to put any man to death. If my <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie</hi> could bring but one example, that the <hi>Pope</hi> before he was a temporall Prince, and when the Citie of <hi>Rome</hi> was ſubiect in temporals
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:150436:47"/>
to the <hi>Roman, Grecian, French</hi> or <hi>German</hi> Emperours did by vertue of his ſpirituall power put any man to death, then he ſhould ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe, if the facts and examples of <hi>Popes</hi> were a ſufficient argument to prooue their right and authoritie.</p>
            <p n="72">72 <hi>Secondly,</hi> although it be true, that the Church by vertue of her ſpirituall power hath authoritie to command, impoſe or enioyne corporall and temporall puniſhments, as I haue often ſaid, and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and generall practiſe of the Church doth confirme the ſame, yet that Eccleſiaſticall authoritie is, by the inſtitution of <hi>Christ,</hi> extended to the diſpoſing of temporals, or to the inflicting of corporall and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall puniſhments, as death, exile, priuation of goods, impriſonment, very many <hi>Doctours</hi> with <hi>Iacobus Almaine,</hi>

               <q>The <hi>Pope, ſaith he,</hi> hath power to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate Kings, and therefore he hath alſo power to depoſe them, becauſe hee that hath power to inflict a greater puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, hath alſo power to inflict a leſſe. We might alſo conclude thus, if it were lawfull to tranſcend from one thing to another of a diuers kinde and nature, The <hi>Pope</hi> hath power to excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate Kings, therefore alſo to kill them, becauſe he that can doe the greater, can doe the leſſe. A man hath power to vnderstand, therefore alſo to flye. A priuate Prieſt hath power to abſolue from ſinnes, therefore alſo from debts. He hath power by force of the Sacraments to giue the kingdome of heauen, therefore alſo to giue an earthly kingdome. Are not theſe and ſuch like good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arguments to perſwade Engliſh Catholikes to caſt away prodigally all their goods, and to deny their allegiance to their Prince? </q>
               <hi>Thus I argued in that place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:150436:48"/>2 Now my <hi>Aduerſarie,</hi> after he had repeated my words, replieth againſt theſe inſtances in this manner.<note n="b" place="margin">Nu. <hi>1. 2.</hi> &amp; ſeq.</note> 
               <hi>Thus ſaith</hi> Widdrington, <hi>ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing and cogging, as you ſee, and ſhewing his malicene leſſe then before. But how ſincerely and truely he alledgeth the argument of</hi> Leſsius, <hi>I know not, for I haue not his booke, neither did I euer reade it, and I make no doubt, but if it had beene laid downe, together with the circumstances thereof, it would haue beene cleere enough of it ſelfe, and not haue needed any defence or explication of mine: And truely although it were as bare, and naked as he makes it, yet the</hi> conſequence <hi>would be good and ſound for ought he ſaith against it, ſeeing he ſaith nothing in effect, but that which may be vrged in like manner against the Apostle Saint</hi> Paul <hi>for the like argument, in his Epistle to the</hi> Corinthians, <hi>where commanding them to constitute, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point Iudges amongst themſelues to decide their controuerſies, he ſaid,</hi> Neſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis quoniam angelos iudicabimus, quanto magis ſecularia? Doe you not know, that we ſhall iudge Angels, and much more ſecular things? <hi>as who would ſay, ſeeing wee haue the greater and more eminent power, haue we not alſo the leſſe? if we haue power ouer ſpirituall things, haue we not alſo power ouer temporall or ſecular things? Thus argued the</hi> Apoſtle <hi>vpon the ſame ground that</hi> Leſsius <hi>doth, to wit, vpon this principle,</hi> qui poteſt maius, poteſtetiam minus.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>And now will this graue Sophister ſcoffe at the</hi> Apoſtles <hi>argument, and ſay, that he might as well haue concluded, that</hi> Qui poteſt intelligere, poteſt volare, Hee which can vnderſtand can flie? <hi>for what can bee more different in kinde and nature, then Angels, and ſecular things? and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe the</hi> Apoſtle <hi>prooued ſoundly by an argument</hi> a maiori ad minus, <hi>that the Church might ordaine, and diſpoſe of ſecular iudgements, becauſe it had a greater power to iudge of Angels: and the reaſon, that mooued him thereto, was the ſame that mooued</hi> Leſſius, <hi>to wit, the ſubordination of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and temporall things to ſpirituall: for albeit ſpirituall and temporall things are of different kinde and order, being conſidered in their owne natures, yet if they be reſpected and conioyned in one Eccleſiaſticall, or myſticall body, and referred to one laſt end (which is Gods ſeruice and glory) they are ſubordinate the one to the other, and therefore are not of diuers orders in that reſpect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 <hi>And if hee grant not this, how will he make good his owne former grant, that the</hi> Pope <hi>hath power to command corporall and temporall things,</hi> quatenus ſpiritualibus deſeruiunt, ſo farre forth as they ſerue ſpirituall things? <hi>doth he not therein acknowledge this ſubordination, and thereupon grant that power in the</hi> Pope, <hi>as a conſequent of his ſpirituall power? why then doth he deny the argument of</hi> Leſſius, <hi>grounded vpon the ſame conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ſeeing he argueth</hi> a maiori ad minus, <hi>concerning things ſubordinate one to another? as who would ſay, that for as much as ſpirituall things are ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour in order and dignitie to temporall things, and all of them principally ordained and referred to Gods glory and ſeruice, therefore he that hath ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:150436:48"/>
power ouer the ſpirituall (which is the greater and higher) hath power alſo ouer the temporall (which is the leſſe and inferiour) to dispoſe thereof, as ſhall be requiſite for Gods glorie and ſeruice, where to both ſpirituall and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall things are ordained.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5 <hi>Whereupon it alſo followeth, that the</hi> Pope <hi>hauing power to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate Kings, may depoſe them, as well becauſe the power to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate is greater then the power to depoſe, as alſo becauſe the temporall ſtate, whereof the</hi> Pope <hi>depriueth the Prince, is ordained to ſerue the ſpirituall, and therefore to be dispoſed by the ſupreame ſpirituall Paſtour, ſo far forth as ſhall be neceſſarie for Gods ſeruice, and the good of the Church.

            </p>
            <p n="6">6 But to omit his bitter and ſlanderous words, the maine ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his reply in this chapter is, as it was alſo in the former chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, grounded vpon the ſubordination of the temporall power to the ſpirituall, and of temporall things to the eternall ſaluation of ſoules, whereof I treated at large aboue in the <hi>ſecond</hi> part, which if the Reader will be pleaſed to peruſe, he will eaſily perceiue, that all my <hi>Aduerſaries</hi> reply in this chapter is of little worth, and that from this ſubordination no ſound argument can be drawne to prooue, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to diſpoſe of temporall things. For albeit the temporall power may be ſaid to be ſubiect to the ſpirituall, or rather temporall <hi>Princes</hi> are in ſpirituals, and in temporals as they are reduced to ſpirituals, ſubiect to the direction or command, and to the ſpirituall coercion, or correction of the ſupreame ſpirituall Paſtour: And albeit temporall goods and ſtates both of the body, and of fortune may be ſaid to be ſubordained, or rather ordained to the eternall ſaluation of ſoules, although not of their owne nature, as I declared in that place, but in this ſenſe, that all Chriſtians, as well <hi>Laikes,</hi> as <hi>Clerkes, Kings,</hi> as <hi>Popes,</hi> are bound to refer all their powers and actions to the eternall ſaluation of their ſoules, in ſo much that as ſpirituall Paſtours are bound to referre and ordaine their ſpirituall power, and the vſe thereof to the eternall ſaluation of their own ſoules, &amp; of thoſe who are ſubiect to them, ſo Chriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are bound to refer their temporall power, &amp; the vſe thereof to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ſaluation of their own ſoules &amp; of their ſubiects: Neuertheleſſe, conſidering that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath left in the Chriſtian world, or common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, as it containeth both temporall &amp; ſpiritual power, earthly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, &amp; the ſpirituall kingdome, or Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> two diſtinct &amp; ſupreme powers, &amp; conſequently independant one vpon the other, and therfore neither ſubordained, or ſubiect one to the other in thoſe things which are proper to each other, as the diſpoſing of ſpiritual things, and ſpiritual coercion or correction are proper &amp; do belong to the ſpiritual power, ſo the diſpoſing of temporall things, and temporall coercion or
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:150436:49"/>
correction are proper, and doe only belong to the temporall power.</p>
            <p n="7">7 So that although it belongeth to the ſupreame ſpirituall <hi>Paſtour</hi> to direct and inſtruct a temporall Prince in his temporall power, as it is <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> that is, to inſtruct him in what manner hee ought to vſe his temporall power according to the grounds of Chriſtian Religion, and to command him to vſe his temporall power, and to diſpoſe of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls in that manner as <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath ordained, to the benefit of his owne ſoule, and of his Subiects, and alſo to command him that he doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell his Subiects by meanes of his temporall power, or with temporall puniſhments to the obſeruing of the lawes of <hi>Christ,</hi> and of his Church, and if the <hi>Prince</hi> refuſe to obey the iuſt commandement of his ſpirituall <hi>Pastour,</hi> it belongeth alſo to the ſpirituall <hi>Paſtour,</hi> to compell him thereunto by meanes of his ſpirituall power, or with ſpirituall puniſhments and Eccleſiaſticall Cenſures, in that manner as the inflicting of Eccleſiaſticall Cenſures may bee called a compulſion, yet the vſing of temporall power, the diſpoſing of temporall things, the compelling with temporall puniſhments, or the inflicting of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall puniſhments, and puniſhing temporally by way of conſtraint, are only proper, and doe belong to the temporall power, for which cauſe S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> as I ſhewed before, did affirme, that <hi>the materiall ſword is, according to our Sauiours command, to be vſed for the Church, but not by the Church, with the hand of the Souldier, not of the Prieſt, at the booke, or direction of the</hi> Pope, <hi>but at the command of the Emperour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8 Now to come to my <hi>Aduerſarie;</hi> although he hath not, as he ſaith, <hi>Leſſius</hi> booke, nor euer reade it, yet I haue both ſeene it, and reade it, and I haue alleadged truly his expreſſe words as they lye, and I doubt not but that my <hi>Aduerſarie</hi> may eaſily get a ſight thereof. But howſoeuer, that which hee ſaith, is very vntrue, that I ſay nothing in effect againſt <hi>Leſſius</hi> argument, but that which may bee vrged in like manner againſt the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul:</hi> for that Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as I ſhewed before in the former chapter, was not grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this maxime, <hi>hee that can doe the greater can doe the leſſe,</hi> whereon <hi>Leſſius</hi> groundeth his argument, for this <hi>maxime</hi> is very vntrue, vnleſſe the greater doeth <hi>actually,</hi> or <hi>vertually</hi> include and imply the leſſe, or which I take for all one, vnleſſe the greater and the leſſe be of the ſame kind or order. But S. <hi>Pauls</hi> argument was grounded vpon this max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime, <hi>hee that is not vnworthie to doe the greater, is not vnworthie to doe the leſſe.</hi> For S. <hi>Paul</hi> intended only to prooue, as I ſhewed before, that Chriſtians were not vnworthie to iudge of ſecular things, becauſe they were to iudge the world, and the Angels, and therefore by the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>a maiori ad minus</hi> they were not to be accounted vnworthie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide ſecular cauſes. Neither hath euery man that power, whereof hee is not vnworthie, but he hath onely that power, which hee, who hath
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:150436:49"/>
authoritie to giue that power, hath granted, although perchance he be not vnworthie to haue a greater power; as to be Lord <hi>Chancellour</hi> is a more great and eminent authoritie, then to be Lord <hi>Chamberlaine,</hi> and yet it is not lawfull thus to argue from that maxime, <hi>he that hath the greater authoritie hath the leſſe, therefore he who is Lord Chancellour is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Lord Chamberlaine,</hi> albeit we might rightly thus conclude, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> did, <hi>a maiori ad minus,</hi> he that is not vnworthie to be Lord <hi>Chancellour</hi> is not vnworthy to be Lord <hi>Chamberlaine,</hi> for that he, who is not vnworthie to haue the greater authoritie, is not vnworthie to haue the leſſe.</p>
            <p n="9">9 If therefore I had denied the <hi>Pope</hi> to haue authoritie to diſpoſe of temporall things, becauſe he had beene vnworthy to haue that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, then I had indeede diſprooued the <hi>Apostles</hi> argument, but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I doe onely for this cauſe deny the <hi>Pope</hi> to haue authoritie to diſpoſe of temporall things, for that <hi>Christ</hi> our Sauiour hath not gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this authoritie to him, but onely to temporall <hi>Princes,</hi> I doe not goe againſt the <hi>Apostles</hi> argument. Neither did the <hi>Apostle</hi> goe about to prooue, that the Church might ordaine and diſpoſe of ſecular iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, taking ſecular iudgements for ſuch, as doe proceed from pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like authoritie, and can not be done by priuate power, but hee onely commanded the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for auoiding of ſcandall to appoint <hi>arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie Iudges</hi> among themſelues, which they might doe by their owne priuate power, and without any derogation to the temporall Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and in caſe of ſcandall they ought alſo ſo to doe, and he onely intended to prooue, that becauſe they were not vnwoorthy to iudge the Angels and the world, much more were they not vnworthy to be <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarie Iudges</hi> in ſecular cauſes. Wherefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to prooue, either by the ſubordination of the temporall power to the ſpirituall, or by any other argument, that the Church might or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine or diſpoſe of thoſe ſecular iudgements, which belong to tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall authoritie, neither can there be drawne any good argument from this ſubordination to prooue the ſame, as I haue ſhewed more amply in the <hi>ſecond</hi> part.</p>

            <p n="19">19 Seeing therefore that there is no dependance, ſubordination, or connexion betwixt excommunication, and depoſition, what connexion, or affinitie can my <hi>Aduerſarie</hi> require betwixt vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and flying, to ſhew a formall diſparitie betwixt <hi>Leſſius</hi> argument, and the inſtance, which I made againſt it?

and therefore in this reſpect they are not of diuers orders, but they haue herein a coherence and connexion.

If <hi>Leſſius</hi> maxime had beene, euery <hi>Pope</hi> that can doe the greater can do the leſſe, and I would haue impugned this maxime by priuate Prieſts, for that priuate Prieſts who can do the greater, as to abſolue from ſins, cannot doe the leſſe, as to abſolue from debts, then indeede I ſhould haue altered the caſe, in transferring the queſtion from <hi>Popes</hi> to priuate <hi>Prieſts,</hi> who are not contained in the ſubiect of that maxime, <hi>euery Pope,</hi> &amp;c. but ſeeing that <hi>Leſſius</hi> maxime is generall, <hi>qui potest maius, poteſt minus, he that can</hi> (which includeth Clerkes, and Laikes, Kings, and Subiects, Pope and Prieſts, and all other men whatſoeuer) <hi>doe the greater can doe the leſſe,</hi> it is ſufficient to prooue this maxime to bee falſe, without altering the caſe, if I can bring but one particular inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, whether it be of Pope or Prieſt, King or ſubiect, wherein this maxime is not true.</p>
            <p n="25">25 And if I ſhould haue argued in this manner, <hi>hee that can doe the greater can doe the leſſe, therefore a priuate Priest who can build a Church can build a Chappell,</hi> would my <hi>Aduerſarie,</hi> trow you haue ſaid, that I had altered the caſe, for that he ſpeaketh of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and I ſpeake of priuate Prieſts? and I would wiſh alſo my <hi>Aduerſarie</hi> to call to mind, what hee ſaid a little before, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> argued from that max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime, which <hi>Leſſius</hi> did, <hi>hee that can doe the greater can doe the leſſe,</hi> and yet I thinke hee will not ſay that either S. <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Leſſius</hi> altered the caſe, although <hi>Leſſius</hi> ſpake only of the <hi>Pope</hi> in his conſequent, and S. <hi>Paul</hi> of priuate men. Alſo I would gladly learne of my <hi>Aduerſarie</hi> in what manner the <hi>maior</hi> propoſition, or <hi>antecedent</hi> of any argument, and conſequently the argument or conſequence it ſelfe may, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his skill in Logicke, bee impugned without altering the caſe, as whether to impugne the <hi>maior</hi> propoſition of this ſyllogiſme <hi>he that was neuer taught Logicke, cannot bee a good Logician, but F.

F. was neuer taught Logicke, and yet hee is a good Logician, and therefore that Maior propoſition, hee that was neuer taught Logicke can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee a good Logician, is</hi> not true, and ſo the conſequence deduced from it cannot bee good, which <hi>Maior</hi> propoſition whether it bee ſufficiently impugned or no, without altering the caſe, albeit I tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the ſubiect of the minor propoſition from F.

               <hi>Thomas Fitzherbert</hi> knoweth full well.</p>
            <p n="26">26 Wherefore it is ſufficient without altering the caſe to impugne any vniuerſall propoſition, which is the <hi>antecedent</hi> of any conſequence, and thereby to impugne the conſequence it ſelfe, which is grounded vpon that <hi>antecedent,</hi> by bringing any one inſtance, wherein that <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent</hi> propoſition is not found to be true, although that inſtance be different either in <hi>ſubiect,</hi> or in <hi>praedicate,</hi> or in both from the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent</hi> of the former argument or conſequence, ſo that the inſtance be contained in that <hi>antecedent</hi> propoſition as a <hi>particular</hi> in the <hi>vniuerſall.</hi> And herein M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> doth bewray his want of of <hi>Logicke,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he bewrayed his want of <hi>Diuinitie,</hi> in affirming, that the <hi>Pope</hi> by Excommunication doth take away the life of the ſoule. For if his skill in <hi>Logicke</hi> had beene but meane, he would quickly haue perceiued, that if one impugne the <hi>antecedent</hi> propoſition of any conſequence, or argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by altering the <hi>conſequent,</hi> he doth not alter the caſe, ſo that the <hi>praedicate</hi> and <hi>ſubiect</hi> of the <hi>conſequent,</hi> which is brought to impugne the <hi>antecedent,</hi> be contained in the <hi>praedicate</hi> and <hi>ſubiect</hi> of the <hi>antecedent,</hi> as a particular in the vniuerſall.</p>
            <p n="27">27 And therefore I haue ſufficiently without altering the caſe confuted that maxime, <hi>he that can doe the greater can doe the leſſe,</hi> by this inſtance of a priuate Prieſt, who is contained in that ſubiect <hi>(hee that can)</hi> as a particular in the vniuerſall, for that a priuate Prieſt can doe the greater, to wit, can abſolue from ſinnes, and yet he can not doe the leſſe, to wit, abſolue from debts: from whence it followeth, that the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid generall maxime is not true, and therefore neither the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of that argument concerning the <hi>Popes</hi> power to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and conſequently to depoſe, which conſequence is grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that generall maxime, can be good. By which it is apparant, that from that <hi>maxime</hi> it can not be rightly concluded, that becauſe the <hi>Pope</hi> hath power to excommunicate, which is the greater, he hath power ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to depriue <hi>Princes</hi> of their kingdomes, or to abſolue ſubiects from their debts, which are the leſſe.</p>
            <p n="28">28 Neither is the depoſing of <hi>Princes,</hi> or the diſcharging of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects from paying their debts neceſſary for the ſpirituall good, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like benefite of the Church, or which is all one to the ſaluation of ſoules; &amp; although they were neceſſary yet ſeeing they are temporall, and not ſpirituall actions, they muſt be performed for the ſame ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all end by temporall and not ſpirituall power: And therefore that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, which my <hi>Aduerſarie</hi> vſeth <hi>a maiori ad minus,</hi> that becauſe a temporall <hi>Prince</hi> may abſolue his ſubiect from the payment of his debt, therefore much more the ſupreame ſpirituall <hi>Pastour</hi> of the Church may doe the ſame, is of little worth, for that the diſpoſing of temporall things, and the inflicting of temporall puniſhments, as is the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:150436:54"/>
diſcharging of ſubiects from paying their debts, doe belong only to the temporall power of Secular <hi>Princes,</hi> and not to Eccleſiaſticall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, which, by the inſtitution of <hi>Christ,</hi> is not extended to the infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of temporal puniſhments, as death, exile, priuation of goods, &amp;c. but only of Eccleſiaſticall or ſpirituall cenſures, as I haue ſhewed more at large in the <hi>firſt</hi> part.</p>
            <p n="29">29 To my fourth and laſt inſtance, which was this, <hi>He that can doe the greater can doe the leſſe, therefore a priuate Priest who hath power to giue the kingdome of heauen, to wit, by vertue of the Sacraments, hath power to giue an earthly kingdome,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> anſwereth as before,<note n="k" place="margin">

               <hi>that</hi> Widdrington <hi>changeth the ſtate of the question, transferring it from the</hi> Pope <hi>to a priuate Priest; for albeit this argument holdeth not in priuate Priests, yet it is good in the</hi> Pope, <hi>if we change the conſideration of the force of the Sacraments (whereto my Aduerſarie</hi> Widdrington <hi>aſcribeth the</hi> Popes <hi>power) to the plenitude of power, by the vertue whereof the</hi> Pope <hi>hath a ſupreame authoritie; and therefore the argument would be good thus:</hi> Poteſt Papa per plenitudinem poteſtatis, &amp;c: The <hi>Pope</hi> may by the plenitude of his power giue the heauenly kingdome, and therefore he may giue an earthly, <hi>for the later being a neceſſarie conſequent of the former, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily comprehended in it, becauſe the</hi> Pope <hi>by the plenitude of his power hath as much authoritie and iuriſdiction, as is neceſſarie for the gouernment and good of the Church. Whereupon it followeth, that whenſoeuer it ſhall be abſolutely neceſſarie and behoouefull for the Church, that he change or tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre a kingdome or Empire, he may doe it, and giue not only the Kingly or Imperiall title, but alſo the right to the crowne, as</hi> Leo <hi>the third,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="30">30 But M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> doth alſo in this anſwere bewray his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and want of <hi>Logicke,</hi> as he did in the former: for it is cleere, that he himſelfe, and not I, doth alter the caſe, and change the ſtate of the queſtion. For the queſtion is not concerning the conſequent of <hi>Leſsius</hi> argument, but concerning the <hi>conſequence,</hi> or that <hi>antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> propoſition, and maxime, <hi>hee that can doe the greater can doe the leſſe,</hi> whereon his conſequence or argument is grounded: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by changing the conſequent, the caſe or ſtate of the queſtion is not altered, when the conſequent is included in the antecedent propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition as a particular in the vniuerſall: as in the former part of this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, <hi>a Prieſt can giue the kingdome of heauen,</hi> is included in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of that maxime, <hi>he that can doe the greater,</hi> and the ſecond part, <hi>therefore he can giue an earthly kingdome,</hi> is included in the ſecond part of that maxime, <hi>therefore he can doe the leſſe;</hi> for that to giue the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen is greater then to giue an earthly kingdome. And to make the caſe more plaine to the vulgar ſort, put the caſe that I ſhould argue thus, <hi>Euery white thing is pleaſant to the taſte, therefore ſugar is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to the taste,</hi> the conſequent you ſee is true, yet the conſequence is
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:150436:54"/>
not good, for that the antecedent propoſition is falſe: And if my <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie</hi> ſhould impugne my conſequence, and prooue my antecedent propoſition to be falſe by this inſtance, <hi>Euery white thing is pleaſant to the taſte, therefore chalke is pleaſant to the taste,</hi> and I ſhould reply to this inſtance, and ſay, that he altereth the caſe, &amp; changeth the ſtate of the queſtion, in transferring it from ſugar, which is ſweet, to chalke, which is vnſauoury, would not my <hi>Aduerſarie,</hi> trow you, according to his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed manner affirme, that my reply is impertinent, abſurd, foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, and ridiculous, and ſend me backe to learne <hi>Logicke</hi> againe?</p>
            <p n="32">32 Now you ſhall ſee, how plainely M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert,</hi> whiles hee vntruely chargeth mee, as you haue ſeene, with altering the caſe, and changing the ſtate of the queſtion, he doth alter, and change it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. <hi>For albeit,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>this argument holdeth not in priuate Priests, yet it is good in the</hi> Pope, <hi>if wee changet he conſideration of the force of the Sacraments (whereto</hi> Widdrington <hi>aſcribeth the</hi> Popes <hi>power) to the plenitude of power, by the vertue whereof the</hi> Pope <hi>hath a ſupreme autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,</hi> &amp;c. But <hi>first</hi> it is vntrue, and I wonder that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to ſay, that I aſcribe the <hi>Popes</hi> power to the force of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſeeing that I ſpeake not one word in my inſtance of the <hi>Pope,</hi> but onely of priuate Prieſts. And if I had aſcribed the <hi>Popes</hi> power to remit ſinnes, and to giue iuſtifying grace, whereby we are made chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, and heires to the kingdome of heauen, to the force and vertue of the Sacraments, had this beene, <hi>forſooth,</hi> any vnſound or bad doctrine? Will my <hi>Aduerſarie</hi> aſcribe the <hi>Popes</hi> power to remit ſinnes, and to giue iuſtifying grace not to the force and vertue of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but to the plenitude of his power, as though the <hi>Pope</hi> by the plenitude of his power could without the Sacraments remit ſinnes, and giue iuſtifying grace? If this be his meaning, all Catholikes know, what Cenſure this doctrine deſerueth, and it is in ſome ſort agreeable to that, which he ſaid a little before, that the <hi>Pope</hi> by excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doeth take away the life of the ſoule, which is iuſtifying grace.</p>
            <p n="32">32 <hi>Secondly,</hi> obſerue, <hi>good Reader,</hi> how my <hi>Aduerſarie</hi> himſelfe altereth the caſe, and changeth the ſtate of the queſtion, and the reaſon, or principle, whereon <hi>Leſſius</hi> conſequence or argument which I did impugne, was grounded. For <hi>Leſſius</hi> his argument was this: <hi>The</hi> Pope <hi>can excommunicate Kings, therefore he can depoſe them, becauſe hee that can inflict the greater puniſhment can inflict the leſſe,</hi> which propoſition ſuppoſeth that generall <hi>maxime, he that can doe the greater, can doe the leſſe,</hi> and this <hi>maxime</hi> was the reaſon and ground of his conſequence or argument. Now my <hi>Aduerſary</hi> changeth this reaſon and ground, and flieth to another. <hi>The Pope,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>may giue the heauenly kingdome, and therefore hee may giue an earthly,</hi> but for what reaſon thinke you? I expected, that he would haue yeelded <hi>Leſſius</hi> reaſon, becauſe <hi>hee that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:150436:55"/>
can doe the greater can doe the leſſe,</hi> which reaſon by thoſe <hi>foure</hi> inſtances I did impugne, but he flyeth from this reaſon to another, <hi>becauſe the</hi> Pope, ſaith he, <hi>hath a plenitude of power, by which hee may giue the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly, and conſequently an earthly kingdome.</hi> Before he affirmed, as you haue ſeene, <hi>that the</hi> Pope <hi>hauing power to excommunicate Kings may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them, as well becauſe the power to excommunicate is greater then the power to depoſe,</hi> and this was <hi>Leſſius</hi> his reaſon, which I impugned in this Chapter, <hi>as alſo becauſe the temporall ſtate, whereof the</hi> Pope <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priueth the Prince, is ordained to ſerue the ſpirituall, and therefore to bee diſpoſed by the ſupreme ſpirituall Paſtour, ſo farre ſoorth as ſhall be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie for Gods ſeruice, and the good of the Church,</hi> and this is the reaſon, which my <hi>Aduerſary</hi> brought in the former Chapter, and was groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in that rule of the Law, <hi>The acceſſory followeth the principall,</hi> which I impugned in that place: Now he yeeldeth another reaſon, which is taken from the <hi>plenitude</hi> of power, which the ſupreme ſpirituall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour hath.</p>
            <p n="33">33 So that you ſee how he himſelfe now changeth the ſtate of the queſtion, and flyeth from <hi>Leſſius</hi> reaſon, which I impugned, to wit, <hi>that hee that can doe the greater can doe the leſſe,</hi> to the plenitude of the <hi>Popes</hi> power, which reaſon neuertheleſſe is of ſmall force, and it is rather <hi>petitio principij,</hi> or, a giuing that for a reaſon, which is the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For albeit I doe not deny, that the ſupreme ſpirituall <hi>Pastour</hi> hath in ſpirituals a <hi>plenitude</hi> of power, that is, a full ſpirituall power to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the Church, which is the ſpirituall kingdome of <hi>Christ,</hi> as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe all Soueraigne <hi>Princes</hi> haue in temporalls a <hi>plenitude</hi> of power, that is, a full temporall power to gouerne their temporall kingdomes, yet how farre this <hi>plenitude,</hi> or fulneſſe of ſpirituall power is extended, whether to the diſpoſing of temporall things, and to the giuing, or depriuing of temporall kingdomes in order to ſpirituall good, as my <hi>Aduerſaries</hi> imagine, or onely to the diſpoſing or diſpenſing of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all things, as many other learned Catholikes are of opinion, this is that, which is now in controuerſie betwixt mee, and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert,</hi> and which he taketh vpon him by all lawes humane, and diuine cleerely to conuince, and therefore to giue that for a reaſon, which is the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, is to commit that fault, which the <hi>Logicians</hi> call <hi>petitio principij.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="34">34 If M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> had argued in that manner, as <hi>Leſſius</hi> did, to wit, <hi>that the</hi> Pope <hi>by the plenitude of his power may giue the heauenly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and therefore hee may giue an earthly, becauſe hee that can doe the greater can do the leſſe,</hi> then he had not altered the ſtate of the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or changed <hi>Leſſius medium</hi> or reaſon, but then I would alſo haue denied his conſequence, and haue impugned that reaſon of maxime, by thoſe <hi>foure</hi> inſtances, and infinite other, which might be brought, which do cleerely &amp; directly confute and ouerthrow that <hi>maxime.</hi> But ſeeing
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:150436:55"/>
that he flyeth from that <hi>maxime,</hi> which <hi>Leſsius</hi> brought for his <hi>medium</hi> or reaſon, to the <hi>plenitude</hi> of the <hi>Popes</hi> power, he both altereth the ſtate of the queſtion, and alſo giueth that for a reaſon, which is the queſtion: For I vtterly deny, that the <hi>Pope</hi> by that <hi>plenitude</hi> of power, which <hi>Christ</hi> hath graunted to his Church, can, I doe not ſay command, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, or enioyne temporall things, as temporall penalties, but diſpoſe of temporall things, or inflict temporall puniſhments, although it bee imagined, that they are neceſſary, as they are not, to the good of the Church and the ſaluation of ſoules, it belonging only to the temporall power of Secular <hi>Princes,</hi> whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath appointed to be <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours</hi> of his Church, to vſe the temporall ſword, to inflict temporall puniſhments, and to diſpoſe of temporall things.</p>
            <p n="35">35 Wherefore, neither the <hi>plenitude</hi> of ſpirituall power in the ſupreme ſpirituall <hi>Paſtour</hi> to giue the heauenly kingdome doth neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily inferre a power in him to giue an earthly kingdome, as a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie conſequent of the former, as my <hi>Aduerſarie</hi> heere affirmeth, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the ſupreme ſpirituall <hi>Pastour</hi> by the <hi>plenitude</hi> of his ſpirituall power hath as much ſpirituall authoritie, and iuriſdiction, as is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for the gouernment and good of the Church, as it is inſtituted by <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Sauiour, neither is the changing, transferring, or giuing of an earthly kingdome, and the diſpoſing of all temporall things <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely</hi> neceſſarie for the ſpirituall good of the Church, or, which is all one, for the ſauing of ſoules, as alſo my <hi>Aduerſarie</hi> here ſuppoſeth, from which neceſſitie, for the moſt part, he draweth an argument to prooue, the aforeſaid power to diſpoſe of all temporall things to be in the <hi>Pope,</hi> (although ſometimes he graunteth,<note n="l" place="margin">

            <p n="42">42 Thus you ſee, what a braue flouriſh D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> hath made, eſpecially to thoſe who haue not read my <hi>Apologie,</hi> as though <hi>forſooth</hi> he had ſaid ſomething to the queſtion which was betwixt mee, and Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> or had brought ſome new argument, which was not anſwered by me in that place, whereas it is as cleere as the Sun, that this his <hi>Dilemma</hi> is a meere euaſion, and ſhift, and altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to the queſtion, and that I did fully ſatisfie it in that very place, both by the grounds of Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and alſo by thoſe authorities, which hee alledged without contradicting my ſelfe at all. For the maine queſtion betweene mee and Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> was, whether this tranſlation of the Empire was done by the authoritie onely of the <hi>Pope,</hi> or by the authoritie both of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and alſo of the people, and I proued cleerly by Cardinal <hi>Bellarmines</hi> owne grounds, and alſo by his owne Authors, that it was done both by the <hi>Pope,</hi> and alſo by the Senate and people of <hi>Rome.</hi> Now D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> ſaith
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:150436:57"/>
little or nothing to this queſtion, but flyeth to another by-queſtion, to wit, <hi>whether it was done iuſtly or vniuſtly,</hi> whereas the principall que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion was onely of the fact, to wit, by whom the fact was done, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the <hi>Pope</hi> alone, or alſo by the people, and not whether the fact was iuſt or vniuſt. So that you ſee heere be two queſtions, the <hi>first</hi> is of the fact, to wit, whether there was any ſuch fact, and by whom, and in what manner it was done, with all other circumſtances, which belong to that particular fact: the <hi>ſecond</hi> is of the iuſtice or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice of the fact, to wit, whether that particular fact conſidered with all particular circumſtances belonging thereunto was iuſtly or vniuſtly done.</p>
            <p n="43">43 The <hi>firſt</hi> queſtion, as D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> himſelfe affirmeth,<note n="t" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 591.</note> is to be decided by the teſtimonies of Hiſtoriographers, <hi>to whom it apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to write barely, ſimply and truely the facts of men;</hi> and the <hi>ſecond,</hi> which doth neceſſarily ſuppoſe the firſt, by Diuines or Lawyers, <hi>to whom it appertaineth to decide what is right or wrong.</hi> Marke now how cunningly D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> to confound his Readers vnderſtanding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerteth the order of theſe queſtions, and putting, as it were, the Cart before the horſe, demandeth that firſt, which he ſhould do laſt, and that laſt, which he ſhould firſt. For <hi>first</hi> he demandeth, whether that fact, to wit, the tranſlation of the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire from the <hi>Grecians</hi> to the <hi>French,</hi> was iuſtly or vniuſtly done; and <hi>ſecondly</hi> he demandeth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was done by the authoritie of the <hi>Pope</hi> alone, or of the people alone, or of the <hi>Pope</hi> and people together; as though one ſhould decide a caſe of conſcience before it be knowen and agreed vpon what the caſe is, and what be all the praticular circumſtances, which doe alter the caſe, belonging thereunto. For it is one caſe or queſtion, to put the tranſlation of the Empire to be done by the <hi>Pope</hi> alone, an <hi>other</hi> by the people alone, a <hi>third</hi> by the <hi>Pope</hi> and people together. Alſo it is one caſe, if it be done by the <hi>Pope</hi> and people together, when the Empire is forſaken and abandoned by the Emperour, or which is all one, with the expreſſe or tacite conſent of the Emperour, for that he refuſeth to rule or reigne ouer the people any longer, and an other caſe, when the Empire is not forſaken by the Emperour, or which is all one, againſt the Emperours will and conſent, for that he will ſtil remaine to be their Emperour. Now if D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> had either put downe the caſe or queſtion plainly with all particular circumſtances belonging thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, it would eaſily haue beene anſwered, or elſe if it had pleaſed him to haue ſet downe my words, and the caſe as I did put it, and prooue it to be lawfull, the Reader would preſently haue ſeene, that D. <hi>Schulcke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> might well haue ſpared to make his aforeſaid argument, or <hi>Dilem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> for that I did fully anſwere it in that place, and that neither I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted my ſelfe, nor that he did anſwere at all my argument, but that

rather by his ſilence, he did ſufficiently acknowledge, that he could not anſwere it at all.</p>
            <p n="44">44 For <hi>first</hi> I did affirme, that the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire was tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the <hi>Grecians</hi> to the <hi>French</hi> by the authoritie, decree, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, conſent and ſuffrage both of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and alſo of the people, and not of the <hi>Pope</hi> alone; and this I proued by Card. <hi>Bellarmines</hi> owne grounds, and alſo by his owne Authours and diuers others; to whom alſo may be added<note n="u" place="margin">Lib. <hi>1.</hi> hiſt.</note>

For albeit I did oftentimes affirme, that ſubiects are bound by the law of God, to obey in ciuill cauſes their temporall Prince, and that in no caſe they haue power to iudge him, or to withdraw their temporall allegiance from him, for that in no caſe an inferiour can iudge his Superiour, as Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe confeſſeth,<note n="d" place="margin">

            <p n="45">45 Wherefore when D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> a little aboue affirmed, that I doe oftentimes graunt, <hi>that the people cannot in any caſe deny ciuill obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to that Prince whom once they haue had,</hi> if his meaning be, that I doe graunt, <hi>that he who is once a Prince, can not of his owne accord leaue to be a Prince,</hi> and can not reſigne his kingdome to the next heire, and that the people are bound to yeeld ciuill obedience to him, who was once their Prince, but now of his owne accord, hath reſigned his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to the next heire, he doth greatly wrong me, and abuſe his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; for to affirme this were fooliſh and ridiculous, and contrarie to all reaſon and practiſe: but that which I affirmed was, that it is very probable, and defended by many graue and learned Catholikes, that the people, who are ſubiect, can in no caſe, nor for any cauſe iudge or depoſe their Soueraigne <hi>Prince</hi> againſt his will, and my reaſon was the ſame, which Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> oftentimes vſeth, to prooue that the

               <hi>Church,</hi> or a <hi>Generall</hi> Councell can not iudge or depoſe the <hi>Pope,</hi> for that it is contrarie to all reaſon for an inferiour or ſubiect to iudge his Superiour, and therefore thoſe Catholikes that holde a <hi>Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell</hi> may in ſome caſes iudge the <hi>Pope,</hi> doe alſo holde that it is ſuperiour, and aboue the <hi>Pope.</hi>

            <p n="46">46 That the <hi>Grecian</hi> Emperours had the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken and abandoned by them, I affirmed in theſe words: <q>Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that (as <hi>Lupoldus,</hi> or <hi>Ludolphus</hi> writeth, and diuers other Authors, as <hi>Nauclerus, Aeneas Siluius,</hi> and <hi>Michael Coccinius</hi> doe inſinuate) the Emperours of <hi>Greece</hi> in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the great, and alſo before his time, to wit, in the time of his father <hi>Pipine</hi> and of his grandfather <hi>Charles Martellus,</hi> did reigne in the <hi>West Empire</hi> only in name, neither could the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor other Churches of <hi>Christ,</hi> or alſo any others, being by the <hi>Longobards</hi> vniuſtly oppreſſed in the ſame Empire haue iuſtice by them, or by their authoritie, and ſo the aforeſaid Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours had the <hi>Weſt-Empire</hi> in a manner forſaken, by gouerning therein only in name, as it appeareth by diuers Chronicles, the <hi>Pope, Senate,</hi> and <hi>people</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> at leaſtwiſe by the tacite conſent of all other Weſterne men, who were ſubiect to the Empire, had euen accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the doctrine of Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> but now related, full right and power (which they could looſe by no cuſtome or tranſlation of the Imperiall Seate, as being to them connaturall, and due by the law of nature) to chooſe themſelues a new Emprour, and conſequently to transfer the Empire, which the <hi>Grecians</hi> kept in the <hi>Weſterne</hi> parts only in name, to <hi>Charles</hi> the great, and his Succeſſours, the Imperiall Seate being in thoſe parts at that time, as it were vacant, or without an <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.</hi> Thus I wrote in my <hi>Apologie</hi>

                  <hi>but as a</hi> Iudge <hi>is taken for a name of a certaine little principalitie. For there is this difference betwixt a</hi> Lord <hi>and a</hi> Iudge; <hi>for a</hi> Lord <hi>ſignifieth one, who hath ſimply power, dominion or Seigniorie, and he hath power to doe what he will, although it be not ordained by the law: But a</hi> Iudge <hi>is he, who hath not a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to command, but he can onely command that, which the lawes command, and he hath a power giuen him to define according to the law, and therefore

he who is ſubiect to a</hi> Iudge, <hi>is not ſubiect to the man, but to the law, but he that is ſubiect to a</hi> Lord, <hi>is ſubiect to the man.

But if we once ſuppoſe a Father, Maſter and Biſhop to haue a <hi>ſupreme</hi> power in temporals ouer their ſonnes, ſeruants and Clerkes, as the <hi>Pope</hi> is ſuppoſed by my <hi>Aduerſaries</hi> to haue ouer all Chriſtian <hi>Princes,</hi> and alſo the crime to deſerue death, then, I ſay, it doth euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow, that if ſuch a Father hath power to depriue his ſonne of his inheritance, he hath alſo power to depriue him of his life, not for that a power to kill is neceſſarily annexed to euery power to depoſe, but to ſuch a power to depoſe, which is a <hi>ſupreme</hi> power ouer all temporals, or rather for that a power to depoſe and to kill, to take away goods, and life are neceſſarily included in euery <hi>ſupreme</hi> power to diſpoſe of all temporals. And therefore all the ſhuffling ſhifting and cunning of this <hi>Doctour</hi> will neuer be able to weaken the force of my conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, but this conſequence will euer remaine good and ſtrong, that if the <hi>Pope</hi> hath power to depriue temporall <hi>Princes</hi> of their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, for that he is their <hi>ſupreme</hi> Lord in temporals in order to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall good, it doth neceſſarily follow, that he hath power alſo to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue them of their liues, if the neceſſitie of the common ſpirituall good require the ſame. And therefore, although the opinion of Card, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> be receaued, not by the <hi>Catholike Church,</hi> as this <hi>Doctour</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truely affirmeth, but by many <hi>Catholike</hi> Doctours, and confirmed by the often practiſe of many later <hi>Popes,</hi> yet alwaies contradicted by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike <hi>Kings</hi> and ſubiects, neuertheleſſe, if theſe Catholike <hi>Doctours</hi> and <hi>Popes</hi> had duely conſidered, what odious and deteſtable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences doe follow from that opinion, they would forthwith in my iudgement haue deteſted the premiſſes from which ſuch hatefull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, (and which this <hi>Doctour</hi> ſeemeth here ſo greatly to abhorre, that he feareth not therefore to accuſe me of impoſing a moſt horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſlander vpon <hi>Chriſts Vicar</hi>) are moſt cleerly and certainly deduced.</p>
               <p n="26">26 Wherefore to conclude this point, that which this <hi>Doctour</hi> anſwereth <hi>ſecondly,</hi> concerning <hi>Athalia,</hi> who was ſlaine by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of <hi>Ioiada</hi> the high <hi>Prieſt,</hi> is nothing to the purpoſe. <hi>To this argument,</hi> ſayth he,<note n="r" place="margin">

                  <hi>I anſwere now, that examples are to be taken ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the conuenience of the matter and perſons.

Now it is euident and approoued by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſent of Catholike Diuines, that the ſhedding of blood is not by the inſtitution of <hi>Christ</hi> forbidden either the <hi>Pope,</hi> or inferiour Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:150436:83"/>
and Prieſts, who therefore with the <hi>Popes</hi> licence make warre, and concurre directly to the effuſion of blood, as oftentimes they haue done, yea now at Rome all effuſion of blood by a iuridicall ſentence, and condemning malefactours to death, and all making of warres by the <hi>Popes</hi> ſubiects are deriued from the <hi>Popes</hi> authoritie, not as he is <hi>Pope,</hi> but as he is a temporall <hi>Prince;</hi> for that which I contend is, that <hi>Prieſts</hi> neither in the <hi>old</hi> law, nor in the new, as they are <hi>Prieſts,</hi> or by their <hi>Prieſtly</hi> power, haue authoritie to condemne any man to death, or to inflict any temporall puniſhment, as death, exile, priuation of goods, impriſonment, or the like.</p>

               <p n="42">42 And to this I plainely anſwered before, as you haue ſeene, in my <hi>Apologie,</hi> by declaring the ſenſe of thoſe equiuocall words, <hi>they created,</hi> or <hi>made Ioas King:</hi> ſort I ſaid in expreſſe words, [that it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true, that <hi>Ioiada</hi> the high <hi>Prieſt, did create Ioas King,</hi> as Cardinall <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> affirmeth, that is, did giue him a right to reigne, which he had not before, ſeeing that preſently after the death of his brethren, whom wicked <hi>Athalia</hi> had treacherouſly murthered, the true dominion, and right to the kingdome did by inheritance belong to <hi>Ioas,</hi> although <hi>Athalia</hi> did tyrannically keepe the poſſeſsion.] For as ſoone as a <hi>King</hi> is dead, the next heire apparant to the Crowne is foorthwith the lawfull <hi>King,</hi> neither doth his annointing, crowning, or acceptance of the people giue, but onely confirme his former <hi>Kingly</hi> right.

               <p n="55">55 Neither is that example of <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> which this <hi>Doctour</hi> vrgeth to diſgrace mee with our Countreymen, to the preſent purpoſe; Seeing that it was not manifeſt, that <hi>Queene Elizabeth</hi> was an <hi>Vſurper,</hi> as was <hi>Athalia,</hi> but rather it is manifeſt, that ſhee was the lawfull <hi>Queene,</hi> conſidering that the Kingdome was left vnto her by the laſt Will, and Teſtament of her Father <hi>King Henry,</hi> and alſo that ſhee was accepted for lawfull <hi>Queene</hi> by a publike decree of the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> without any contradiction, or claime of <hi>Queene Mary</hi> our now <hi>Soueraignes</hi> mother, or of any other, who might pretend a right to the kingdome.

the putting the true heire, and rightfull <hi>King</hi> into the poſſeſſion of his inheritance and kingdome, or concerning the putting <hi>Athalia</hi> to death, did not argue in <hi>Ioiada,</hi> either any true authoritie to <hi>create</hi> a <hi>king de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouo,</hi> that is to giue him a right to the kingdome, which right he had not before, or any proper authoritie due only to the high Prieſt, and which might not alſo be common to euery faithfull ſubiect in the like caſe: but that which <hi>Ioiada</hi> did concerning the killing of <hi>Athalia,</hi> he did by the authority and conſent of the King, Princes and people; and what hee did concerning her depoſing, he was bound to doe by the law of God, of nature, and nations.

And this euery faithfull ſubiect in the like caſe is bound to doe, and by the Law of nature and nations hath authoritie ſo to doe: and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:150436:93"/>
the conſent of all kingdomes, and the authoritie of the rightfull <hi>King</hi> doth giue ſufficient warrant to the ſame.

So that the principall thing, which the <hi>Prieſt</hi> was to doe in the caſe of leproſie, was to iudge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſignes, and tokens preſcribed by the law of <hi>God,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any one was infected with leproſie or no: and if hee found him infected to declare him ſo to bee, and to condemne him of the ſayde vncleanneſſe; after which declaration the leper was by the law it ſelfe foorthwith debarred both from ſacred, and alſo ciuill conuerſation: for that hee was not onely depriued of all ſacred rites, but alſo he was to bee ſeuered from the reſt of the people, who were not defiled with ſuch vncleanneſſe, and commanded to liue apart out of the Campe, or Citie.</p>
               <p n="84">84 Now the execution of this law, foraſmuch as concerned the ſpirituall penaltie, did belong principally to the <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> who was the chiefe miniſter of ſacred things; but concerning the temporall or ciuill penaltie, which was to bee debarred from ciuill conuerſation, the execution thereof, if the leper would not of his owne accord vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe the penaltie, did belong to the Ciuill Magiſtrate, who was the miniſter of ciuill, or temporall things: As alſo, when any tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall puniſhment, as death, whipping, or ſuch like was preſcribed by the law againſt malefactours, although the crime was ſpirituall, as I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie, vſurping the office of a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> &amp;c. the execution belonged to the temporall Iudge, who in temporalls had authoritie ouer them.

               <p n="85">85 Wherefore from this example of King <hi>Ozias</hi> nothing elſe can forcibly be prooued, but that in the olde law it belonged to the <hi>Prieſts</hi> to declare the law of <hi>God,</hi> and that onely <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and not <hi>Lay-men</hi> were to intermeddle in ſacred things.

                  <note place="margin">2. Paralip. 26.</note> and what was done by King <hi>Ozias. First</hi> therefore King <hi>Ozias,</hi> ſaith the Scripture, <hi>entering into the temple of our Lord would burne incenſe vpon the Altar of incenſe. And incontinently</hi> Azarias <hi>the</hi> Prieſt <hi>going in after him, and with him the</hi> Prieſts <hi>of our</hi> Lord, <hi>eightie, most valiant men, they reſiſted the</hi> King, <hi>and ſaid, It is not thy office,</hi> Ozias, <hi>to burne incenſe to our</hi> Lord, <hi>but of the</hi> Prieſts, <hi>that is, of the children of</hi> Aaron, <hi>which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to this kind of miniſterie, goe out of the Sanctuarie, contemne not, becauſe this thing ſhall not be reputed to thee for glorie by our Lord.</hi> Here is nothing done, as you ſee, by the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> which is not ſpirituall. And who maketh any doubt, but that the <hi>Prieſts</hi> alſo of the new law may reſiſt <hi>Kings,</hi> if they attempt to intermeddle in ſacred things, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long onely to <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and tell them, that it is not their office, but of the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> which are conſecrated to this kind of miniſterie, and command them to goe out of the Church, and not to contemne the law of <hi>God,</hi> becauſe it will not be reputed to them for glorie by our Lord <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="86">86 But <hi>ſecondly,</hi> King <hi>Ozias being angrie and holding in his hand the Cenſar to burne incenſe threatned the</hi> Prieſts. <hi>And forthwith there aroſe a leproſie in his forehead before the</hi> Prieſts. <hi>And when</hi> Azarias <hi>the high</hi> Prieſt <hi>had beheld him, and all the reſt of the</hi> Prieſts, <hi>they ſaw the leproſie in his forehead, and in haſte they thrust him out; yea and himſelfe being ſore afraid made haſte to goe out, becauſe he felt by and by the plague of our Lord.</hi> And here alſo is nothing, which the <hi>Prieſts</hi> might not doe by their ſpirituall authoritie.

he now being ſtricken by <hi>God</hi> miraculouſly with the plague of lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie did of his owne accord depart in haſte out of the temple, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> doth ſufficiently confirme, ſaying,<note place="margin">

               <p n="87">87 And <hi>thirdly,</hi> King <hi>Ozias,</hi> ſaith the Scripture, <hi>was a leper vntill the day of his death, and he dwelt in a houſe apart, full of the leproſie, for the which he had beene cast out of the houſe of our Lord.

               <p n="93">93 Neither is it to bee marueiled, if there bee no example in the old Teſtament, wherein we reade, that <hi>Kings</hi> were iudged for leproſie by any other then by the <hi>High Prieſt:</hi> for that in the olde Teſtament we haue but one onely example of any <hi>King,</hi> to wit, of this <hi>Ozias,</hi> who was infected with leproſie, yet the words of the holy Scripture, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is giuen authoritie to <hi>Prieſts</hi> to iudge of leproſie, are common, as well to <hi>inferiour Prieſts,</hi> as to the <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> neither is there any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception made of the perſons that are to bee iudged to bee infected, or not infected with leproſie.

                  <hi>they ſaw the leproſie in his forehead, and in hast they thrust him out.</hi> And therefore this <hi>Doctour</hi> doth not well affirme, that in the olde law wee haue not an example, wherein <hi>Princes</hi> were iudged for leproſie by any other, then by the <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> ſeeing that in this example of King <hi>Ozias</hi> the <hi>High Priest</hi> did not any thing, which the teſt alſo of the <hi>Priests</hi> did not, and which if the <hi>High Priest</hi> had not beene preſent at that time, the other <hi>Prieſts</hi> might not according to the law haue done without him.</p>
               <p n="94">94 Wherefore that alſo, which this Doctour anſwereth to my <hi>ſecond conſequence,</hi> which was, that if Card. <hi>Bellarmines</hi> argument were of force, it would prooue, that <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and alſo <hi>Priests</hi> might depoſe <hi>Princes</hi> not onely for hereſie, but alſo for all other mortal crimes, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe. <hi>I anſwere,</hi> ſaith hee;<note n="n" place="margin">

                  <hi>It is true, that all ſinnes are ſignified by leproſie, but not therefore</hi> Princes <hi>may bee iudged for all ſinnes whatſoeuer by euery</hi> Prieſt. <hi>Becauſe as we now haue ſaide, greater ſinnes are reſerued to greater Prelates, and ſome to the</hi> Pope <hi>alone, especially when we ſpeake of perſons, that are placed in the higheſt degree of dignitie.</hi>

firſt, <hi>although</hi> Ozias <hi>ſhould haue beene depriued only of the adminiſtration of the kingdome, and conſtrained to giue it ouer to his ſinne, yet had kept the right, and authoritie to reigne, as my Aduerſarie</hi> Widdrington <hi>will haue it, neuertheleſſe Card.</hi> Bellarmines <hi>argument would be ſtrong, and vnſhaken.

But my</hi> Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie <hi>denieth, that an hereticall</hi> King <hi>can be depriued of the adminiſtration of his Kingdome, and he ſaith that he can only be depriued of the receiuing of Sacraments.</hi>

For the <hi>antecedent</hi> propoſition of Card. <hi>Bellarmines</hi> argument contained two parts; the <hi>one</hi> was, that King <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zias</hi> was for leproſie depriued of his kingdome, and authoritie to reigne and from hence he concluded, as you haue ſeene, <hi>If therefore the</hi> Prieſt <hi>of the old law had power to iudge a</hi> King, <hi>and to depriue him of his kingdome for corporall leproſie, why may not a</hi> Prieſt <hi>now doe the ſame for ſpirituall leproſie?</hi> and of this part, to wit, of depriuing <hi>Princes</hi> of their kingdomes, and of their right, or authoritie to reigne I did only ſpeake in this part of my anſwere: And if this part, which was the principall point of Card. <hi>Bellarmines</hi> argument be ſuppoſed to be falſe, as this <hi>Doctour</hi> doth ſuppoſe, how can his argument, for as much, as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth this point, ſtand ſtrong, and vnſhaken.</p>
               <p n="100">100 The <hi>ſecond</hi> part of Card. <hi>Bellarmines</hi> agrument was, that King <hi>Ozias</hi> was for leproſie depriued by the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> of the <hi>adminiſtration</hi> of his kingdome; and of this <hi>ſecond</hi> part I did not ſpeake one word in this part of my anſwere, but only of the depriuing him of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, dominion, or right to reigne: And I affirmed, that although the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of the old law had authoritie to iudge a leper, and by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratiue ſentence, or commandement to denounce, that he was to be ſeuered from the reſt of the people, which was only to declare the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement and law of God, conſidering that this ſeparation was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by the expreſſe commandement of God after the <hi>Priest</hi> had iudged him to be infected with leproſie, yet from hence it cannot be well inferred, that the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of the old law had authoritie to depriue <hi>Kings,</hi> that were infected with leproſie, of their kingdomes euen <hi>per ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidens,</hi> and <hi>conſequently,</hi> vnleſſe their dwelling apart from the reſt of the

hee was depriued of the gouernment by the <hi>high Prieſt.</hi> And now this <hi>Doctour</hi> being preſſed with this anſwere bluſheth not to ſay, <hi>That this is nothing to the matter,</hi> as though to confute that which hee himſelfe affirmetn to bee <hi>manifeſt,</hi> to wit, <hi>that King</hi> Ozias <hi>was by the high</hi> Prieſt <hi>depriued of his Kingly gouernment for corporall leproſie is nothing to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> But to ſuch ſhamefull windings, turnings, and ſhiftings are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time brought men, otherwiſe learned, rather then they will plainly and ſincerely confeſſe themſelues to haue groſly erred, in coyning their falſe, or fallible opinions, for true and vndoubted points of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith.</p>

               <p>If this bee enough for this <hi>Doctour,</hi> I ſhall eaſily agree with him heerein, for that I doe willingly grant, that the <hi>high Prieſt</hi> might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund King <hi>Ozias</hi> being infected with leproſie to dwell in a houſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part; Onely this I muſt admoniſh him, that <hi>Ozias</hi> was bound to dwell in a houſe apart, not ſo much by the <hi>commandement</hi> of the <hi>high Prieſt,</hi> if wee will ſpeake properly, as by the <hi>commandement</hi> of almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <hi>God,</hi> who by his law did expreſly ordaine, that all lepers ſhould dwell apart from the reſt of the people; and the <hi>Priests</hi> office only was to iudge according to the ſignes and tokens preſcribed by the law whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were infected with leproſie or no, and to declare the law of GOD, which are ſpirituall not temporall actions; abſtracting from which law the <hi>high Prieſt</hi> had no authoritie to command King <hi>Ozias,</hi> or any other leper to liue in a houſe apart from the reſt of the people. Wherefore this <hi>commandement</hi> of the <hi>high Prieſt</hi> was not any <hi>conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue commandement</hi> of his owne, impoſing a new obligation vpon King <hi>Ozias,</hi> to which he was not tyed before, although the <hi>high Prieſt</hi> had not commanded him, but it was onely a <hi>declaratiue commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or a declaration of Gods law and commandement, whereby all lepers were long before commaunded to dwell in a place apart from the reſt of the people: But from hence this <hi>Doctour</hi> cannot gather, that the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of the new law may for ſpirituall leproſie depriue Kings of their kingdomes, or the adminiſtration thereof, or of their right and freedome to dwell in their Cities, or Pallaces, and ſeparate them by way of temporall conſtraint from all ciuill conuerſation of men, vnleſſe hee will grant with <hi>Iohn Wicklefe,</hi> that theſe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are by the law of <hi>Christ</hi> annexed to ſpirituall leproſie, as in the old law the dwelling in a place apart from the reſt of the people was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to corporall leproſie. Neuertheleſſe I doe not deny, that the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:150436:107"/>
                  <hi>Prieſts</hi> all of the new law haue authority to declare what is ſpirituall lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and what crimes doe notably infect the ſoule, and what puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are by the law of <hi>Christ</hi> annexed to ſuch maladies, and alſo to ſeparate heretikes and other ſpirituall lepers from the ſacred, religious, or ſpirituall conuerſation of the faithfull, for theſe are ſpirituall, not temporall actions, and puniſhments.</p>
               <p n="115">115 <hi>But</hi> Ozias, <hi>liuing in a houſe apart, could not,</hi> ſaith this <hi>Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, conuerſe with the people, and ſo he was enforced to permit abſolutely to to his ſonne the adminiſtration of the kingdome, that nothing at all ſhould be referred to him, concerning the affaires of the kingdome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>firſt,</hi> it is not true, that King <hi>Ozias</hi> ſpeaking properly was <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actus,</hi> that is, <hi>enforced</hi> or compelled by corporall force, and violence; or by the <hi>coactiue</hi> force of the law, which conſiſteth in the inflicting of temporall puniſhments, to liue in a houſe apart from the reſt of the people, but onely he was bound thereunto by the <hi>directiue,</hi> or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding force of the law of <hi>God,</hi> which ordained, that all lepers ſhould bee ſeparated from the reſt of the people, and dwell alone by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues out of the Campe; for ſeeing that the <hi>King</hi> was <hi>ſupreame</hi> in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralls, and ſubiect therein to none but <hi>God</hi> alone, and the <hi>High Prieſts</hi> were ſubiect to him therein, and might bee puniſhed by him with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall puniſhments, as I ſhewed before, hee could not bee ſubiect to the coactiue, or enforcing power of the law, which ordained the inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any temporall puniſhment; And therefore wee neuer read in the holy Scripture, that the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> of the old law, whom my <hi>Aduerſaries</hi> affirme to haue authoritie to inflict vpon a <hi>King</hi> a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall puniſhment, did euer attempt to put any <hi>King</hi> to death, who had committed any crime that deſerued death according to the law, as you find many <hi>Kings</hi> to haue committed ſuch crimes, as <hi>Dauid</hi> committed adulterie, which according to the law of God was to bee puniſhed with death, and moſt of the <hi>Kings</hi> of Iſrael were Idolaters, whom <hi>God</hi> commanded to be put to death, and this crime alſo of King <hi>Ozias,</hi> for vſurping the office of a <hi>Prieſt</hi> deſerued death according to the Law.</p>
               <p n="116">116 <hi>Secondly</hi> therefore, although he was in ſome ſort, ſpeaking improperly, <hi>enforced,</hi> or compelled, that is, he was bound by the law vnder paine of ſinne to liue in a houſe apart; from the reſt of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by reaſon of his leproſie, yet it was the law of <hi>God,</hi> and not the <hi>high Prieſt,</hi> but onely as iudging him to bee a leper, and declaring the law of <hi>God,</hi> and his indignation againſt thoſe who ſhould tranſgreſſe his law, that <hi>compelled</hi> him thereunto, which <hi>declaration</hi> being a meere ſpirituall action, without doubt did, according to the law of <hi>God</hi> in the old law, belong to the function of the <hi>high Prieſt;</hi> and therefore the moſt that from hence can be inferred is this, that the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of the new law haue alſo authoritie to declare the law of Chriſt, and to iudge

what is ſpirituall leproſie, and what puniſhments are by the law of <hi>Chriſt</hi> appointed againſt hereſie, and other crimes which may infect the ſoule; but that ſpirituall <hi>Paſtours</hi> haue now authoritie to inflict temporall puniſhments vpon heretikes, or any other ſpirituall lepers, it cannot from hence be gathered by any <hi>probable</hi> reaſon.</p>
               <p n="117">117 <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it is very vntrue, that becauſe King <hi>Ozias</hi> was by the law commanded to liue in a houſe apart, ſo long as hee remained a leper, it doeth conſequently follow from thence, that he was alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced, bound, or compelled to permit <hi>abſolutely</hi> the adminiſtration of the kingdome to his ſonne, <hi>ſo that nothing concerning the affaires of the kingdome ſhould bee referred to him:</hi> for that a <hi>King</hi> may liue in a houſe apart, not onely out of the Citie, but alſo out of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and yet he may gouerne his kingdome by his <hi>Miniſters</hi> in ſuch ſort, that the chiefeſt things hee may reſerue to himſelfe, as diuers <hi>Kings</hi> by their <hi>Vice-Roys</hi> doe gouerne forraine kingdomes, reſeruing diuers things, as the placing or diſplacing of the chiefeſt Officers, the making of warre againſt their neighbour <hi>Princes,</hi> or ſuch like im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant affaires to themſelues: and therefore from the dwelling of <hi>Ozias</hi> in a houſe apart, either in the Citie, or out of the Citie, it cannot bee ſufficiently gathered, that hee was therefore <hi>enforced to permit abſolutely the adminiſtration of the kingdome to his ſonne, ſo that nothing concerning the affaires of the kingdome ſhould bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to him;</hi> eſpecially ſeeing that, as this <hi>Doctour</hi> ſayeth, <hi>le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie doeth not take away the iudgement of the mind, and wiſedome neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie to gouerne.</hi>

For in the old law the dwelling of lepers, after they were declared ſo to be by the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> in a houſe apart from the reſt of the people, was expreſly ordained by the law of <hi>God,</hi> and therefore ſuppoſing now with Card. <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that the dwelling of a <hi>King</hi> being infected with leproſie in a houſe apart from the reſt of the people ſhould by any neceſſarie conſequence inferre, that hee is conſequently depriued of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or the adminiſtration thereof, it is no meruaile, that the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of the old law had authoritie to depriue ſuch <hi>Kings per accidens</hi> and <hi>conſequently,</hi> that is, to declare them depriued by the law of GOD, of their kingdomes, or of the adminiſtration thereof. But in the new law neither the depriuation of a temporall kingdome, or of the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration thereof, nor the loſſe of any temporall Iuriſdiction doth by the law of GOD, or by any other neceſſarie conſequence follow ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall leproſie, or any intrinſecall propertie of Eccleſiaſticall Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:150436:114"/>
neither is it in power of ſpirituall Paſtours, as <hi>Almai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> ſaid, to inflict any temporall puniſhment, as death, baniſhment, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of goods, &amp;c. nay nor ſo much as to impriſon, as <hi>very many Doctours,</hi> ſaith hee, doe affirme, but onely to inflict ſpirituall Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, or puniſhments: And therefore the ſimilitude of Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> betwixt corporall and ſpirituall leproſie in the old and new law, is this defectiue, and ſo the <hi>conſequence</hi> of his argument is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſufficient. Thus much touching my <hi>firſt</hi> anſwere to the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his argument.</p>
               <p n="146">146 Marke now how ſleightly this <hi>Doctour</hi> would ſhuffle ouer my <hi>ſecond</hi> anſwere and reaſon, which did cleane ouerthrow Card. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> conſequence grounded vpon the nature of a figure, and the thing figured, euen according to his owne grounds. For whereas I anſwered, as you haue ſeene, that becauſe a figure, as Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith, is alwayes leſſe perfect, and of an inferiour degree then the thing which is figured, it doeth not follow, that hereſie, which is figured by corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall leproſie; muſt bee puniſhed with a temporall puniſhment, becauſe corporall leproſie was puniſhed therewith, but with a puniſhment of a higher degree, to wit, with a ſpirituall puniſhment, D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> replieth thus: <hi>I anſwere,</hi> ſaith hee<note n="t" place="margin">
                     <hi>pag.</hi> 552.</note>, <hi>As hereſie, which is a ſpirituall le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie, is farre more pernicious, then corporall leproſie, ſo Excommunication is a puniſhment of a higher degree, then the ſeparating of lepers. For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication doth not onely depriue of the companie, and liuing together of men in one houſe, but alſo of participation of Sacraments, and Suffrages of the Church. But that Excommunication beſides doeth depriue of ciuill ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, and ſometimes hath annexed the depriuation of temporall goods, and alſo of the kingdome it ſelfe, doth not diminiſh, but increaſe the greatnes and excellencie of the puniſhment of ſpirituall leproſie aboue the puniſhment of corporall leproſie. Wherefore it is most true, that the thing figured is of an higher degree then the figure. And in this manner the Euchariſt is of an higher degree then manna, or the Paſchall lambe, becauſe theſe doe nouriſh the body, that nouriſheth the ſoule, although alſo thoſe accidents of the Euchariſt are profitable to the nouriſhment of the body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="147">147 But obſerue the egrigious fraude of this <hi>Doctour.</hi> For that propoſition of Card. <hi>Bellarmine, Figures muſt of neceſſitie be of an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our order and excellencie, then the things figured,</hi> is to be vnderſtood of <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures formally,</hi> as they are figures, for it little importeth, that thoſe things, that are figures, be <hi>materially</hi> of an equall, or not inferiour or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and excellency, then the things figured, ſo that <hi>formally</hi> as they are figures, or in that they are figures, they are leſſe perfect, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, then are the things figured.

he ſaith nothing to the purpoſe, and to the confuting of my anſwere. For neither <hi>Manna,</hi> nor the <hi>Paſchall lambe</hi> are <hi>figures</hi> of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> as the accidents of the <hi>Eucharist</hi> doe concurre to the nouriſhing of the body, but onely as they are profitable to the nouriſhing of the ſoule: Neither was corporall leproſie, or the ſeparation of lepers from ciuill conuerſation a <hi>figure</hi> of ſpirituall leproſie, and of Eccleſiaſticall ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Excommunication, as corporall leproſie doth infect the body, and Excommunication doth ſeparate from ciuill conuerſation, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as ſpirituall leproſie doeth infect the ſoule, and Eccleſiaſticall Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication doth ſeparate from Eccleſiaſticall, or Spirituall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: for that a figure muſt in all thoſe things, wherein it is a figure, be more noble, and excellent, then is the thing which is figured.

                  <hi>to fulfill a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure is not to doe that very thing, which the law preſcribeth to bee done, but to put in place thereof ſome thing more excellent, which to ſignifie that figure did goe before, as</hi> Chriſt <hi>did not fulfill the figure of Circumciſion, when he himſelfe was circumciſed, but when hee ordained</hi> Baptiſme <hi>in the place thereof.</hi> Thus Card. <hi>Bellarmine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="148">148 From whence it euidently followeth, that the ſeparation of corporall lepers in the old law from ciuill conuerſation could not bee a figure of the ſeparation of ſpirituall lepers, alſo from ciuill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation: for that ciuill conuerſation is one, and the ſelf ſame thing, and not another thing more excellent, which according to Cardinall <hi>Bellarmines</hi> doctrine muſt ſucceede in place of the figure, but the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of this figure muſt bee the ſeparating of ſpirituall lepers from ſpirituall, or Eccleſiaſticall conuerſation. And therefore although Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Excommunication hath by the lawes of the Church an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed vnto it, in that manner, as I haue before declared, the excluding by way of commandement from ciuill conuerſation, if otherwiſe by the law of GOD, and nature, we are not bound ciuilly to conuerſe, yea and alſo according to Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> the depriuing of temporall kingdomes, or at leaſtwiſe of the adminiſtration thereof, yet the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of lepers in the old law from ciuill conuerſation, or the depriuing them of temporall kingdomes, or adminiſtration could not, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Cardinall <hi>Bellarmines</hi> grounds, bee a figure of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Excommunication in the new law, as Excommunication is pretended to worke the ſame effects, but onely as it worketh more excellent effects, to wit, the ſeparating of the faithfull from ſpirituall conuerſation, and excluding them from the kingdome of heauen.</p>
               <p n="149">149 Wherefore, if wee doe reſpect onely the nature and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of a <hi>figure,</hi> it is euident that Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> according to his owne principles hath not any way prooued, that becauſe corporall

               <p n="39">39 And therefore, as temporall <hi>Kings</hi> doe giue to their Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants,

But if ſome perſons doe not feare theſe Cenſures, and be not amended by them, this is not to bee attributed to the weakeneſſe, defect, or imperfection of the Cenſure, which of it ſelfe

               <hi>it is to be conſidered, that ſeeing in all common-wealths (I ſpeake of ſuch as are Chriſtian) there is a compoſition and combination of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Societies, all tending to the perfection of mans nature, as of husband and wife, maiſter and ſeruant, Prince and ſubiect (of all which reſulteth the ciuill Societie:) and againe, ſeeing that in this ciuill Societie or Common-wealth there is an Eccleſiaſticall Societie euident and diſtinct in it ſelfe, by different Magiſtrates and lawes, whereby the ciuill Societie is vnited with the Celeſtiall and heauenly Hierarchies, and the members thereof made</hi> ciues Sanctorum, &amp; domeſtici Dei, the citizens of Saints, and the houſhold ſeruants of God;<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.</note>

and more perfect Societie; ſo in like manner the common-wealth it ſelfe with all her inferiour Societies are naturally ordained for the religious, and Eccleſiasticall Societie, that is to ſay, the</hi> Church, <hi>tending thereto as to the ſupreme, and most perfect Societie that is on earth, whereby it, and all other Societies are perfected, and humane nature finally aduanced to that ſupernaturall end, and felicitie, whereto</hi> God <hi>hath ordained it.

For the reaſon, why the Societie of the husband and wife, and of the maſter, and ſeruant are ordained for the family, and againe the family for the Towne, and Citie, and the Citie for the whole Common-wealth, is, for that the Societie of man and wife, of maſter and ſeruant, are parts and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Family, and the Family is a part and member of the Towne and Citie, and the Citie is a part, and member of the whole Common-wealth, or Kingdome, and therefore it muſt needes follow, that all theſe particular Ciuill Societies are <hi>naturally</hi> ordained for the whole Ciuill Common-wealth, or Kingdome, which they compoſe, as all parts and members are <hi>naturally</hi> ordained for the whole bodie, which is compounded of them.

for that ſhee can doe all the actions, functions, and offices of them, and inflict the ſame temporall puniſhments, that temporall Common-wealths can inflict, but only for that ſhee can doe more noble, and more worthie actions, functions, and offices, and inflict more grieuous, and more dreadfull puniſhments, to wit, ſpiritual, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the nature, and conditions of a ſpirituall Common-wealth, and a Religious, or Eccleſiaſticall Societie.</p>

            <p n="31">31 <hi>Thirdly</hi> therefore although it be true, that the ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> and other <hi>Paynims</hi> did preferre Religion, and the worſhip of their <hi>Gods</hi> before any other temporall thing, and in regard thereof, when any thing was to be handled in the <hi>Senate,</hi> that which corcerned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was <hi>firſt</hi> of all diſpatched, whereupon alſo they gaue great tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall authoritie, honour, priuiledges, and exemptions eſpecially to their <hi>chiefe Prieſt,</hi> or <hi>Biſhop,</hi> to whom all other inferiour <hi>Prieſts,</hi> as the <hi>Flamines,</hi> the <hi>Salij,</hi> the <hi>Augures,</hi> the <hi>Epulones,</hi> the <hi>Aruales,</hi> the <hi>Veſtales,</hi> yea and he, that was called <hi>Rex ſacrorum,</hi> the <hi>King of ſacred things,</hi> were ſubiect; in ſo much that the dignitie of the <hi>chiefe Biſhop</hi> was accounted the <hi>ſecond</hi> in the Common-wealth, and the next to <hi>Kingly dignitie;</hi> and many times the ſame man was both a <hi>Religious Prieſt,</hi> and alſo a <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Magistrate,</hi> as <hi>Q.

and iudiciall lawes of the old <hi>Teſtament</hi> doe ceaſe, inſomuch that no Chriſtian now is bound to obſerue any one of thoſe lawes, by vertue and force of the law, it is to be conſidered, that our Sauiour <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath now inſtituted a new <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> and a new <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> And albeit he hath determined, and limited the <hi>perſons,</hi> who are to offer <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> and the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> which is to be offered; for the <hi>perſons,</hi> or <hi>Prieſts</hi> to offer <hi>Sacrifice</hi> he hath appointed onely his <hi>twelue Apoſtles,</hi> and thoſe, who are duely conſecrated and ordained by them, or their Succeſſours, and the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> which they ought to offer, is one onely, to wit, the vnbloody offering of his immaculate body and blood vnder the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble formes of bread and wine, by vſing thoſe words, which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in his laſt Supper did vſe and inſtitute, yet he did neither limit the place, where this <hi>Sacrifice</hi> ſhould be offered, nor the ceremonies, which were to be vſed in the offering thereof, but he left theſe to the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Church,</hi> and to the ſupreme <hi>Paſtours</hi> or Gouernours there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to determine them as they ſhould thinke conuenient. Beſides this authoritie, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> gaue to the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of the new law ouer his true body, he gaue them alſo authority, and Iuriſdiction ouer his my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall body, which are the faithfull, which authority and Iuriſdiction is ſignified by the keyes of the kingdome of heauen, which our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our promiſed to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and in his perſon to the reſt of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> whom he did repreſent, of which authority I haue ſpoken ſomewhat in the former chapter, and alſo in my <hi>Apologie, Theologicall Diſputation,</hi> and <hi>Appendix</hi> thereunto.</p>
            <p n="41">41 And from hence the <hi>Reader</hi> may eaſily gather <hi>two</hi> things; the <hi>one</hi> is, the difference betwixt the <hi>Prieſts</hi> in the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and in the <hi>law written:</hi> for that both in the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> and of <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>Prieſts</hi> had not their authoritie from men, but from GOD, neither was it in the power of the temporall common-wealth to extend, or diminiſh their Prieſtly authoritie: but in the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> the <hi>Prieſts</hi> had their authoritie from the ciuill Communitie, or common-wealth, whereof they were parts, and members, and in whoſe name, and by whoſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie they were made <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and had power to offer ſacrifice; and it was in the power of the common-wealth to extend, or diminiſh, or to take quite away their Prieſtly authority, and to appoint and ordaine, in what manner, and with what ceremonies, and what things they ſhould Sacrifice to God, and to determine of all things concerning Religion; yea and the common-wealth did alſo determine what Gods they were to woorſhip; and therefore it was decreed by the <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> that no <hi>Emperour</hi> ſhould be canonized or made <hi>God,</hi>

            <p n="42">42 The <hi>ſecond,</hi> which followeth from the former, is, that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering in the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> the Prieſthood was wholly ſubiect and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:150436:143"/>
vpon the ciuill Common-wealth, in ſo much that the <hi>Prieſts</hi> in the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> were ſubiect and ſubordinate, not onely in tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, but alſo in ſpirituals, and in all things, which concerned Religion, and the publike ſeruice of <hi>God</hi> to the ſupreme Gouernours of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Common-wealth, from whom they receiued all their Prieſtly authoritie, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> very vnlearnedly concludeth, <hi>that according to the</hi> law <hi>of</hi> nature <hi>the temporall State and power is ſubiect and ſubordinate to the ſpirituall, and that the ſupreme temporall Magiſtrate was commanded and corrected with temporall puniſhments, as occaſion required by the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall</hi> ſeeing that the quite contrarie I haue moſt cleerly conuinced out of <hi>Abulenſis,</hi> and the ſame may very plainely be gathered from the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of <hi>Sotus, Valentia, Suarez, Vaſquer,</hi> and other Diuines treating either of Sacrifices in generall, or of the Sacrifice of the Maſſe, or of the Prieſthood of Chriſt. And therefore I may bouldly ſay, that if in the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> an <hi>Oath</hi> had beene propounded by the ciuill Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, wherin the <hi>Religious Prieſts</hi> ſhould haue acknowledged, that they might not only for temporall crimes, but alſo for ſpirituall, and which meerely concerned Religion be puniſhed by the ſupreme temporall Gouernour with temporall puniſhments, and alſo be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of their <hi>Prieſtly</hi> function, and authoritie, the <hi>Prieſts</hi> would haue admitted it as lawfull; And if an <hi>Oath</hi> had beene propounded by the <hi>Prieſts</hi> to haue themſelues exempted from the authoritie of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme temporall Gouernour euen in ſpirituall or religious affaires, much leſſe in temporall, the <hi>Ciuill</hi> Common-wealth, or ſupreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours thereof would not haue admitted it as lawfull, but would haue puniſhed the <hi>Prieſts</hi> for preſuming to vſurpe ſuch an authoritie.</p>
            <p n="43">43 Wherefore thoſe laſt words of my <hi>Aduerſarie</hi> to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Barlow</hi> are a moſt vaine, friuolous, and idle floriſh: For albeit the ancient <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers,</hi> and learned <hi>Paynims</hi> being guided by the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and light of naturall reaſon, whoſe doctrine alſo in this point our <hi>moderne Diuines</hi> doe follow, did cleerely ſee, that in the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> when no poſitiue law of <hi>God</hi> was publiſhed, the <hi>Ciuill</hi> common-wealth, or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme gouernours thereof had the chiefe command, and authoritie in all matters as well concerning Religion, as State, to whom the <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Prieſts</hi> were wholy ſubiect as well in ſpirituall, or religious, as in temporall affaires, yet they did not turne the word vpſide downe, or peruerted the courſe of Nature, but knew right well, that things leſſe perfect are not to be preferred before the more perfect, the body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſoule, ſenſe before reaſon, temporall things before ſpirituall, policie before Religion, earth before heauen, and the world before God. And therefore there is none, but ſuch ignorant men as my <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie</hi> is, that can, or will affirme the new <hi>Oath</hi> of allegiance to be repugnant to the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> or to the light of nature reaſon, for that

it denyeth the authoritie of ſpirituall <hi>Pastours</hi> to puniſh temporally ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute <hi>Princes,</hi> or to depriue them of their kingdomes, or dominions.</p>
            <p n="44">44 And by this the inſufficiencie of the reſt of Mr. <hi>Fitzherberts</hi> Diſcourſe will eaſily appeare. <hi>This was ſome part,</hi> ſaith he,<note n="i" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 101. <hi>num.</hi> 12.</note> 
               <hi>of my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in my</hi> Supplement <hi>concerning the law of Nature, whereby thou ſeeſt,</hi> good Reader, <hi>that I haue ſufficiently ſhewed two things: the one that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the law of Nature the temporall ſtate, and power is ſubordinate, and ſubiect to the ſpirituall, when they are conioined in one body, no leſſe then the familie is ſubordinate and ſubiect to the Common-wealth in like caſe, becauſe the end of the temporall power is ſubordinate to the end of the ſpirituall power, which ouerthroweth my</hi> Aduerſaries <hi>falſe principle, to wit that the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall, and ciuill Societie are ſo diſtinct in nature, and office, that though they be ioined together, yet they haue no dependance the one of the other, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which falſe ground, and vaine ſuppoſition often affirmed by</hi> Barclay, <hi>and him, and neuer proued by either of them, they found all their falſe doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="45">45 But how vntrue this is I haue already ſhewed. For in the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> the temporall ſtate, and power was not ſubiect and ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to the ſpirituall, or Religious, except only in excellencie, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, whereof there is no queſtion, but contrariwiſe the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> were ſubiect in ſpirituall and religious affaires to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme ciuill Gouernour, when they were diſtinct perſons, neither did they make two diſtinct Common-wealths, as they doe in the law written, but the ciuill Common-wealth had authoritie to diſpoſe of all matters as well concerning Religion as ſtate, and not only to make <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and to giue them <hi>Prieſtly</hi> power, but alſo to increaſe, diminiſh, alter, or to take away from them their <hi>Prieſtly</hi> authoritie, and to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of all things both temporall and ſpirituall, which is not ſo in the law written, wherein <hi>Priests</hi> haue their authoritie from the poſitiue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and law of <hi>God</hi> himſelfe.</p>
            <p n="46">46 True it is, that the Heathen Common-wealths gaue great authoritie, priueledges, and exemptions to thoſe perſons, whom they choſe and appointed to be their Prieſts, eſpecially to the <hi>chiefe Prieſt,</hi> or <hi>Biſhop</hi> (whereof reade <hi>Alexander</hi> lib. 2. cap. 8. and lib. 3. cap. 27.) to whom the <hi>Romanes</hi> gaue ſuch great honour, that they did eſteeme him next to the <hi>King,</hi> or ſupreme temporall Prince, and gaue him authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to command, and alſo to puniſh the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>ſacred rites,</hi> and all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inferiour <hi>Prieſts.</hi> Yea euen to <hi>Vestall Virgins,</hi> who were <hi>Prieſts</hi> of the Goddeſſe <hi>Veſta</hi> ſuch honour was giuen by the <hi>Romanes,</hi> that if by chance they ſhould meete any malefactour, that was led to death, hee ſhould not for that time be put to death,<note place="margin">Plutarch. <hi>in Numa</hi> Alex. <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 12.</note> vpon condition that the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin</hi> muſt ſweare, that her meeting of him was caſuall, and not of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. But from hence it cannot be gathered, that the religious <hi>Prieſts</hi> had by the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> ſuch authoritie, priueledges, and preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:150436:144"/>
but only that the Common-wealth in honour of Religion did grant them ſuch temporall honour, and authoritie, and would haue them to be obeyed in ſome matters of great moment vnder paine of death.</p>
            <p n="47">47 Now in the new law in what manner the temporall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, or rather thoſe perſons, who are parts, and members ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, are ſubiect to ſpirituall Paſtours I haue at large declared aboue in the <hi>ſecond part,</hi> where I haue ſufficiently proued out of <hi>Card. Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> owne grounds, that the coniunction of temporall power, and of ſpirituall ſubiection in the ſame Chriſtian man is not ſufficient to make the temporall, and ſpirituall Common-wealth among Chriſtians one totall body, or Common-wealth, whereof the <hi>Pope</hi> is the ſupreme viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble head for then the <hi>Pope</hi> muſt be both a temporall, and ſpirituall Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of all Chriſtendome, and Chriſtians; and that although they ſhould make one totall body, or Common-wealth, whereof <hi>Chriſt</hi> only is the head in that manner, as I there declared, yet from thence it could not be concluded, that the temporall power, or Common-wealth is <hi>per ſe,</hi> and <hi>naturally</hi> ſubiect, and ſubordinate to the ſpirituall power, or Common-wealth, but only that Chriſtian <hi>Princes,</hi> not as they haue temporall power, but as being members of the Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> they haue ſpirituall ſubiection, and conſequently in ſpiritualls, and not in temporalls are ſubiect to the ſpirituall power, or common-wealth, and the ſpirituall Paſtours thereof: And there alſo I anſwered all the arguments, which D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> brought to proue the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Let M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> impugne that Treatiſe, and then he may haue ſome cauſe to brag, that this doctrine of mine, and <hi>Barclaies</hi> is a falſe, and vaine ſuppoſition of our owne; In the meane time the <hi>Reader</hi> may cleerely ſee, how vainely, and friuolouſly he hath proued by the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> that the temporall power is ſubiect, and ſubordinate to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, and that in the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Nature Religious Prieſts,</hi> as they were ſuch, might command, and correct temporally the temporall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, or ſupreme temporall <hi>Prince,</hi> whereas the quite contrary is manifeſt by the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="48">48 <hi>The other thing,</hi> ſaith M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert, that I haue ſhewed, is, that by reaſon of this naturall ſubordination, and ſubiection of the lawes, and leſſe perfect Societies to the higher, and more perfect, it is most conforme to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the head of the Church, who is the ſupreme ſpirituall Magiſtrate, may command, and correct all inferiour Magiſtrates, as well temporall as ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, when the neceſſitie either of the whole body, or of the Church only (which is the most perfect, and ſupreme Societie) doth require it, as in like caſe the ſupreme ciuill Magiſtrate (who is Prince, and head of the Common-wealth) iuſtly commandeth, and puniſheth the heads of Families, or Cities, notwithſtanding that the ſaid Families, and Cities are diſtinct Societies, and
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:150436:144"/>
bodies, and haue their lawes, and Magiſtrates apart, no leſſe then the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and Church haue theirs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="49">49 But <hi>first</hi> it is vntrue, that there is any naturall ſubordination, and ſubiection of the temporall power, or Common-wealth to the ſpirituall, except in dignitie and perfection, which is nothing to the purpoſe, and whereof no man maketh doubt; neither doth the dignity and perfection of the more noble, and excellent Societie inferre a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioritie in command, and authoritie ouer the leſſe worthy, and leſſe noble Societie, vnleſſe we will haue the companie of <hi>Goldſmiths</hi> to haue authoritie and command ouer the <hi>Pewterers:</hi> and I haue ſhewed a little before moſt euidently, that in the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> the Ciuill common-wealth had the whole charge, and command of all things, as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Religion, as to State, and that the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> or publike Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of religious rites, were inſtituted, ordained, changed, depriued, commanded, and puniſhed by the ciuill Common-wealth, vpon whom euen in all matters belonging to Religion, and the publike wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God they wholy depended: and therefore no maruaile, that from this vaine, and friuolous ſuppoſition of the naturall ſubordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſubiection of the temporall Common-wealth to the ſpirituall often affirmed by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert,</hi> but neuer proued by him by any one probable argument, none but vaine, and friuolous collections can be gathered.</p>
            <p n="50">50 <hi>Secondly,</hi> I haue alſo ſufficiently ſhewed, that there is not the like caſe betwixt the ſupreme ciuill Magiſtrate and the heads of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and Cities, and betwixt the head of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the ſupreme Magiſtrate of the ciuill Common-wealth, as my <hi>Aduerſarie</hi> heere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truly affirmeth, for that not only thoſe perſons, who are the heads of Families, and Cities, but alſo the Families, and Cities themſelues are parts, and members of the whole ciuill Common-wealth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in all ciuill matters to be directed, commanded, and temporally corrected by the ſupreme ciuill Magiſtrate: but the temporall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth it ſelfe, or the temporal <hi>Prince,</hi> as he hath temporal power, or in meere temporall matters, is not a part, &amp; member of the Church, or ſpirituall kingdome of Chriſt, but onely as hee hath ſpirituall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, and therefore onely in ſpiritualls, and in ſuch which are redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the nature of ſpiritualls, hee is to be directed, and commanded, and to be ſpiritually, not temporally corrected by the ſupreme ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Paſtour. And ſo indeed it is conforme to the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> that is, it is not repugnant to naturall reaſon, but it is fit, decent, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, although not neceſſary, that the chiefe Religious <hi>Prieſt</hi> ſhould haue authoritie graunted him, either by the ciuill common-wealth, as it was in the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> or by the poſitiue inſtitution and law of <hi>God,</hi> as it was in the law written, to puniſh the tranſgreſſours
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:150436:145"/>
of religious rites with ſome kinde of puniſhments, but that the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> did giue no authoritie at all to thoſe who were appointed to be publike Miniſters of religious rites, to commaund or puniſh at all, the ciuill common-wealth, or Soueraigne <hi>Prince</hi> thereof, vpon whom both in ſpiritual and ciuill matters they wholly depended, is altogether repugnant to naturall reaſon.</p>
            <p n="51">51 <hi>But</hi> Widdrington <hi>himſelfe,</hi> ſaith M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Fitzherbert<note n="k" place="margin">

               <hi>doth not deny, but that I haue prooued thus much effectually, ſo farre foorth, as concerneth a power to command, and a ſpirituall manner of puniſhment, ſeeing that hee ſaith (as you haue heard in the beginning of the laſt Chapter)</hi> that I haue effectually prooued nothing elſe by the diuine, or naturall law, but that the temporall power is ſubiect to the ſpirituall in ſpirituall things, and in temporall, as they are reduced to ſpirituall, ſo farre forth as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth commandement, and a ſpirituall, not a temporall manner of puniſhment. So he.</p>
            <p n="52">52 But although I doe willingly grant, that he hath ſufficiently prooued by the law of <hi>God,</hi> that the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the ſpritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Paſtours thereof haue authoritie granted them by the poſitiue inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and law of <hi>God</hi> to command in ſpirituall things, and in tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, as they are reduced to ſpirituall, all Chriſtians both <hi>Princes,</hi> and ſubiects being parts and members of the <hi>Church,</hi> and to puniſh them with ſpirituall puniſhments, if they ſhall contemne his iuſt command; yet my meaning was neuer to affirme, that he hath effectually proued, either that there is any naturall ſubiection, and ſubordination of the temporall common-wealth to the head of the Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept onely in dignitie and perfection, or that the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting from the poſitiue inſtitution and law of <hi>Christ,</hi> hath granted to ſpirituall Paſtours authority to puniſh, or commaund abſolute <hi>Princes;</hi> for that all the authority, which ſpirituall <hi>Paſtours</hi> now haue, doth either proceed from the poſitiue inſtitution and law of <hi>Christ,</hi> or from the graunt of <hi>Christian Princes,</hi> and not from the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>nature.</hi> Wherefore from theſe wordes of mine, which hee hath related, this onely can be concluded, that he hath effectually prooued by the law of <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>nature,</hi> that the temporall power is ſubiect to the ſpirituall in ſpirituall things, and ſpirituall puniſhments; and that he hath proued nothing elſe. For by what rules of Logicke can my <hi>Aduerſary</hi> inferre, that becauſe I grant, <hi>that he hath effectually proued by the law of God,</hi> or <hi>nature, that the temporall power is ſubiect to the ſpirituall,</hi> &amp;c.

he hath effectually proued by the law of <hi>God,</hi> or nature, that the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall power is ſubiect to the ſpirituall, &amp;c. it is ſufficient that hee hath prooued by the law of <hi>God,</hi> that the temporall power is ſubiect to the ſpirituall in ſpirituall things, and in temporall, as they are reduced to ſpirituall, ſo farre foorth as concerneth commandement, and a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, not temporall manner of puniſhment: for by the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> he hath prooued no ſuch thing, nor brought any one probable argument to prooue the ſame.</p>

            <p n="58">58 <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is vntrue, that bloodie puniſhments by death, or maiming are <hi>idly mentioned heere by mee:</hi> ſeeing that hee himſelfe in the former <hi>paragraph</hi> did affirme, that the head of the <hi>Church</hi> may by way not only of commandement, but alſo of puniſhment, <hi>dispoſe of whatſoeuer belongeth to the Ciuill Common-wealth,</hi> and conſequently both of goods, and bodies, whereof no doubt the ciuill common-wealth may diſpoſe: and in the <hi>ſecond Chapter</hi> alſo hee expreſly taught, <hi>that the</hi> Pope <hi>hauing power ouer my ſoule, and being withall the ſupreame Gouernour of the whole Church hath alſo power ouer my life, albeit with the liues of Princes, it being an odious queſtion, hee will not meddle,</hi> and a little after hee affirmeth, <hi>that the</hi> Pope <hi>hath power ouer the temporall goods, ſtates, and bodies of all Chriſtians,</hi> and conſequently, according to his doctrine, alſo of all Chriſtian <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Princes.</hi> Why then doth he now ſay, <hi>that bloodie puniſhments by death, or maiming are idly mentioned heere by mee,</hi> when I affirme, that none but the ſupreame ciuill Superiour hath power to puniſh his ſubiect, or inferiour with the puniſhment of death, maiming, or depriuation of goods?

            <p n="59">59 <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that hee may not take occaſion heereafter to cauell at my words, when I affirmed that true reaſon teacheth, that euery Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour hath power to puniſh his inferiour with ſome puniſhment pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate to his authoritie, my meaning was, as alſo my words doe ſufficiently ſignifie, to ſpeake onely of <hi>ſupreame Superiours,</hi> who haue both <hi>directiue,</hi> and <hi>coerciue</hi> authoritie, that is power both to command, and puniſh: for a <hi>delegate Superiour</hi> hath no other authoritie then is granted him by his <hi>ſupreame Superiour:</hi> And therefore it is not againſt the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> or the preſcript of true naturall reaſon, that ſuch a <hi>delegate Superiour</hi> may haue power giuen him only to command, and not to puniſh, or to puniſh one man, and not another, or to inflict one puniſhment and not another, according as his <hi>ſupreame Superiour</hi> ſhall thinke it fit, and conuenient.</p>
            <p n="60">60 Now you ſhall ſee in what manner M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> prooueth, <hi>that I contradict my owne grant, the holy Scriptures, and the ancient, and common practiſe of the Church. You haue heard</hi> Widdrington <hi>graunt,</hi>

               <hi>that the ſpirituall Superiour may commaund corporall, and temporall things, as they ſerue the ſpirituall, and are reduced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Why then may hee not puniſh his ſubiect in his body, or tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall goods for the ſame respect?</hi> But <hi>firſt</hi> what contradiction, I pray you, is it, to affirme that the ſpirituall Superiour may for a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all end command, or enioyne temporall penalties, and to deny, that he may not for a ſpirituall end inflict temporall penalties? <hi>Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> as all <hi>Philoſophers</hi> know, is <hi>an affirming, and denying of the ſelfe ſame thing, and in the ſelfe ſame manner,</hi> but to affirme one thing, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny another is no contradiction at all. Wherefore to proue, that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict my owne grant, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> muſt proue, which he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer doe, that I affirme, and deny the ſelfe ſame thing, as to affirme, and deny, that the ſpirituall Superiour hath power to commaund tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall penalties, to affirme, and alſo to deny that hee hath power to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict temporall penalties, for otherwiſe to accuſe mee of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction for affirming one thing, to wit, that the ſpirituall Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our hath power to commaund temporall penalties, and for denying another thing, to wit, that hee hath not power to inflict tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall penalties, is to accuſe himſelfe of moſt groſſe, and palpable ignorance.</p>
            <p n="61">61 <hi>Secondly,</hi> I anſwere his demaund with other like demaunds. Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> as you haue ſeene aboue,<note n="t" place="margin">

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:150436:147"/>
of the ſoule, and I alſo added, which he cunningly concealed, when they are neceſſary for the good alſo of the body; why then may not the ſoule her ſelfe alſo exerciſe bodily actions for the ſame reſpect, without the helpe or actiue concurrance of the body it ſelfe? <hi>Alſo</hi> the ſoule may command one corporall member to puniſh another, if it be neceſſary for the good either of the ſoule, or of the body, as the hands to whip the ſhoulders, or to cut off ſome contagious member, as the fingers, the toes, the feete, or legges if they be poyſoned, why then hath not the ſoule herſelfe for the ſame reſpect power to doe the ſame? <hi>Moreouer</hi> a ghoſtly father may enioine his penitent for ſatisfaction of his ſinnes, and to auoide the danger of falling backe into ſinne, to giue Almes, to build Hoſpitalls, to afflict his body with faſting, watching, diſciplining, haire cloth, and ſuch like to ſhunne this, or that company, &amp;c. Why then, if the Penitent refuſe to doe theſe things, may not his ghoſtly father for the ſame reſpect take away his money from him, and giue Almes, and build Hoſpitalls therewith, and afflict his peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents body whether hee will, or no &amp;c? Why did S. <hi>Bernard</hi> affirme, that the <hi>materiall ſword</hi> is by <hi>Chriſts</hi> commandement to be drawne forth for the Church, but not by the Church, with the hands of the Souldier, but at the becke, or declaratiue commaundement of the Prieſt?</p>
            <p n="62">62 But the true, and proper reaſon why ſpirituall Paſtours haue authoritie to command temporall puniſhments, and not to inflict temporall puniſhments, or to puniſh temporally, muſt bee taken not from any naturall ſubordination, or which is all one, from any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie ſubiection, which according to the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> the ciuill common-wealth, or <hi>temporall Princes</hi> haue to the <hi>Religious Societie,</hi> or to the Miniſters of ſacred rites, for that in the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> it belonged to the ciuill common-wealth to diſpoſe of all matters as well concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Religion, as ſtate, as I haue ſhewed before; but it muſt bee taken from the poſitiue inſtitution of <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Sauiour, and from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and conditions of the lawes, weapons, armour, and puniſhments, which according to the inſtitution of <hi>Christ</hi> are due to the <hi>Church,</hi> as he hath diſtinguiſhed them from the nature and conditions of the lawes, weapons, armour, and puniſhments, which are proper to the temporall Common-wealth. For there is no doubt to be made, but that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour if it had pleaſed him, might haue ordained, that the chiefe viſible head of the <hi>Church</hi> ſhould bee both a temporall, and ſpirituall <hi>Monarch,</hi> as the <hi>Canonists</hi> will haue him to be, and might haue giuen him autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to inflict not only ſpirituall but alſo temporall puniſhments, and not only to command, but alſo to vſe the materiall, temporall, or ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill ſword, as alſo if it had pleaſed him, hee might haue giuen him no power to command at all, but only to preach the word of God, and to
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:150436:148"/>
declare his law, and to miniſter Sacraments to them that ſhould vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, and of their owne accord demaund them; wherefore what power the <hi>Pope</hi> and other ſpirituall Paſtours haue, wee cannot gather from the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> or the neceſſary preſcript of naturall reaſon, but onely from the poſitiue inſtitution and law of <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="63">63 But this difference betwixt the power to command, and to inflict temporall puniſhments will be made more plaine and perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, by examining his next Diſcourſe, and by declaring morefully the true ſenſe and meaning of thoſe former words of mine. <hi>[The ſpirituall Superiour may command corporall and temporall things, as they ſerue ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and are reduced thereto:]</hi> Which my <hi>Aduerſarie</hi> either doth not, or would ſeeme not to vnderſtand. <hi>For ſeeing that,</hi> ſaith he<note n="u" place="margin">

            <p n="64">64 The reaſon why the ſpirituall Paſtours of the <hi>Church</hi> may command temporall puniſhments, and yet may not inflict them, or puniſh temporally; or, which is all one, why the <hi>directiue</hi> power of ſpirituall Paſtours is extended to <hi>temporall</hi> puniſhments for a ſpirituall end, and yet their <hi>coerciue</hi> power is not for the ſame reſpect extended alſo to <hi>temporall</hi> puniſhments, but reſtrained and limited to <hi>spirituall,</hi> or Eccleſiaſticall Cenſures, I fully declared in my <hi>Appendyx</hi> to Fa. <hi>Suarez,</hi> which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> might well haue ſeene, ſeeing that it was publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the yeere before this his <hi>Reply</hi> came forth.<note place="margin">See <hi>Appendix part.</hi> 1. <hi>ſec.</hi> 4.</note> For Fa. <hi>Suarez</hi> argued in this manner: <hi>The Eccleſiaſticall power of the Church, as it is</hi> directiue, <hi>or commanding is not by thoſe words of our Sauiour,</hi> Quodcunque ligaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:150436:151"/>
the obiect of the ſpirituall <hi>coerciue,</hi> or puniſhing power, wee haue no other way <hi>a priori,</hi> then the holy Scriptures, wherein the inſtitution and law of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is contained: and the reaſon is, becauſe there is no naturall neceſſitie, that ſpirituall Paſtours muſt haue authority to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict temporall puniſhments, and by the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> and the auncient Romanes, and other Heathen common-wealths, who were guided by the light of naturall reaſon, I haue ſufficiently prooued before, that this naturall ſubordination, and ſubiection (eſpecially in <hi>coerciue,</hi> or puniſhing temporall authority, or authority to puniſh temporally) of the ciuill common-wealth to religious <hi>Priests</hi> (which my <hi>Aduerſary</hi> ſuppoſeth) is a very vaine and idle fiction, or <hi>Chymaera,</hi> &amp; faigned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any colour or ſhew of true naturall reaſon. Wherefore ſeeing that <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Sauiour might by his <hi>abſolute power</hi> haue giuen to the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Paſtours of his <hi>Church</hi> a greater or leſſer <hi>coerciue,</hi> or puniſhing au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, then hee hath giuen them, yea and might haue giuen them no <hi>coerciue</hi> authority, or power to puniſh at all ſo much as with ſpirituall Cenſures, to know what <hi>coerciue</hi> or puniſhing power, he hath actually giuen them, cannot be proued by the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> or by naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but onely by the holy Scripture, and the ancient Fathers, who are the ſincere Expoſitours thereof, and liued before this controuerſie concerning the <hi>Popes</hi> temporall authority ouer temporall <hi>Princes</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, and therefore could neither fauour the one ſide, nor the other.</p>
            <p n="75">75 The <hi>ſecond</hi> is, that there is but little difference except in words betwixt the doctrine of the <hi>Diuines,</hi> and <hi>Canoniſts</hi> concerning the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall <hi>coerciue,</hi> or puniſhing power. For although the <hi>Canoniſts</hi> doe ſuppoſe, that all the power as well <hi>coerciue,</hi> as <hi>directiue,</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath giuen to the Paſtors of his <hi>Church,</hi> is <hi>in ordine ad bonum ſpirituale, in order to ſpirituall good,</hi> or for the ſauing of ſoules, which the <hi>Diuines</hi> call <hi>indirectly,</hi> yet becauſe the <hi>Canoniſts</hi> hold, that the <hi>Pope</hi> by the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath ſupreme authoritie to <hi>inflict</hi> as well temporall as ſpirituall puniſhments, and conſequently to puniſh all Chriſtians euen temporall <hi>Princes</hi> as well temporally, as ſpiritually, therefore they feare not to affirme conformably to their grounds, that the <hi>Pope</hi> is the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme temporall, and ſpirituall <hi>Monarch</hi> of the whole Chriſtian world, and hath true temporall <hi>coerciue</hi> authoritie. But the <hi>Diuines</hi> although in effect grant as much, yet they differ in words, and that <hi>coerciue</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of ſpirituall Paſtours, which the <hi>Canonists</hi> call <hi>temporall,</hi> for that it worketh the ſame <hi>temporall</hi> effect, and hath the ſelfe ſame obiect, which the temporall, or ciuill <hi>coerciue</hi> authoritie hath, wil not, <hi>forſooth,</hi> call it <hi>temporall</hi> authoritie, but <hi>ſpirituall</hi> authoritie in temporalls, and that not <hi>directly,</hi> but <hi>indirectly,</hi> or <hi>in order to ſpirituall good,</hi> whereas the <hi>Canoniſts</hi> doe alſo hold, that the <hi>Popes</hi> temporall <hi>coerciue</hi> authoritie, or his <hi>coerciue</hi> authoritie in temporalls is alſo in order to ſpirituall good.
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:150436:151"/>
But this diſtinction of <hi>directly,</hi> and <hi>indirectly</hi> was purpoſely inuented by the later <hi>Diuines</hi> to make their doctrine concerning the <hi>Popes</hi> authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to diſpoſe of all temporalls, and to inflict temporall puniſhments to be more plauſible to the vulgar ſort, and to be leſſe odious to Chriſtian <hi>Princes,</hi> and their loyall ſubiects, who can not brooke to heare any man ſay, that <hi>abſolute</hi> and <hi>Soueraigne Princes</hi> are not <hi>ſupreme,</hi> but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect in temporalls to <hi>ſpirituall Paſtours,</hi> whereas in effect, and very deed the <hi>Diuines,</hi> notwithſtanding this their diſtinction, doe make <hi>abſolute Princes,</hi> whom the ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> with vniforme conſent haue euer accounted to be next vnder GOD in temporalls, and not to be tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally puniſhed but by GOD alone, to be as much ſubiect in <hi>temporalls</hi> to <hi>ſpirituall Paſtors,</hi> and to be no leſſe temporally puniſhed by them, then the <hi>Canoniſts</hi> doe. So that the difference betwixt their opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>coerciue</hi> power of ſpirituall Paſtours is rather <hi>verball,</hi> and only about words, them <hi>reall,</hi> and in very deede.</p>

            <p n="80">80 <hi>But the contrarie doctrine,</hi> ſaith Suarez, <hi>may ſeeme to haue ſome ground in thoſe word;</hi> Matth. 18.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But from this place,</hi> ſaith <hi>Suarez, nothing can be gathered. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe one might alſo gather from thence, that whoſoeuer diſobeyeth the</hi> Church, <hi>is excommunicated by the law of God. Alſo, for that otherwayes the Church doth excommunicate no man, but declare him to be excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by the law of God, becauſe he doth not obey the</hi> Church, <hi>which how abſurd this is, it is manifeſt of it ſelfe, &amp;c.</hi> Firſt, <hi>therefore by thoſe words is ſignified this generall maxime, that thoſe who doe not heare the</hi> Church, <hi>doe grieuouſly ſinne, and eſpecially if they be obſtinate, and that therefore they are to be accounted, and ſhunned as grieuous ſinners, as are</hi> Heathens and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licanes. Secondly, <hi>It is ſignified that</hi> Chriſt <hi>our Lord will giue to his</hi> Church <hi>power to binde and looſe.

Cenſure it ſelfe, <hi>or a commandement in particular, but onely in generall of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyding ſinners, who are diſobedient to the</hi> Church, <hi>vnder which generall law is comprehended an accomodate diſtribution to ſay ſo, to wit, a commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſhunne euery one that is diſobedient to the</hi> Church, <hi>according to the degree and manner of the prohibition and ſeparation which is made by the</hi> Church <hi>her ſelfe.

And ſo by all theſe teſtimonies conferred together it is euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gathered, that there is no ground in Scripture for vs to ſay, that any</hi> Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure <hi>is by the</hi> law <hi>of</hi> God <hi>annexed to hereſie, rather then to other ſinnes: And therefore the contrary opinion is farre more</hi> probable, <hi>and it is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion of other Doctours.

            <p n="83">83 Wherefore <hi>laſtly,</hi> and <hi>principally,</hi> all that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert,</hi> or any other can conclude from the former places of holy Scripture, or ſuch like is, that the <hi>Church</hi> hath power in order to the ſpirituall good of ſoules to enioyne temporall puniſhments, and to commaund the faithfull not to conuerſe ciuilly with Heathens, Publicanes, or noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſinners, when otherwiſe by the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> they are not bound to conuerſe ciuilly with them, whereof I neuer made any doubt. And therefore obſerue, <hi>good Reader,</hi> the fraude and ignorance of this man, who pretended to prooue, that I contradicted my ſelfe <hi>in granting that the ſpirituall Superiour could command temporall puniſhments, but not inflict them,</hi> ſeeing that neither fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the reduction of temporall things to ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, nor from the nature &amp; effects of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> nor from thoſe places of holy Scripture, which he heere hath brought, he concludeth any other thing, then that Chriſtians are <hi>commaunded</hi> to account him an Heathen, and a Publican, who will not heare the Church: that the <hi>Apostle commanded</hi> the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> not to eate with notorious ſinners and diſobedient perſons: that S. <hi>Iohn commanded</hi> the faithfull not to receiue heretikes into their houſes nor ſo much as to ſalute them, all which I willingly granted, but of the other part of the contradiction, which was the principall thing he ſhould haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that <hi>I muſt conſequently grant, that the ſpirituall Superiour can alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict

            <p n="84">84 For if a Chriſtian ſhould not obſerue the aforeſaid comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, and will not account them for <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Publicanes,</hi> who ſhall not heare the <hi>Church,</hi> if hee will eate and drinke with notorious ſinners, and receiue heretikes into his houſe, and ſalute them, what puniſhments then can the ſpirituall Superiour inflict vpon ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? can hee depriue him of his temporall life) libertie, dignities, or goods? can hee by temporall force whip him, ſend him into baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or ſuch like, or onely exclude him from the ſpirituall conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the faithfull, depriue him of ſpirituall graces, dignities, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges, and command other <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to account him as a <hi>Heathen, Publican,</hi> and notorious ſinner?

I grant alſo, that ſpirituall Paſtours may doe the like. For <hi>S.

            <p n="89">89 Neuertheleſſe I doe not deny, that when both the man, and wife are <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and the one cannot liue with the other without danger of being drawne into hereſie, or ſome other grieuous ſinne, the <hi>Church</hi> hath authoritie to command the partie that is in danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peruerted to leaue the companie of the other conſort, and ſo by way of <hi>command</hi> to puniſh the offender, but this is nothing to that, which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> pretended to prooue, to wit, <hi>that the Church hath power to inflict temporall puniſhments, and that I contradicted my ſelfe in granting that the spirituall Superiour might command temporall puniſhments,

               <hi>Fitzherberts</hi> argument, I anſwered in the ſaid <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix</hi> to <hi>Suarez,</hi> that as the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>authority</hi> which Parents haue ouer their children, is granted to them by the ciuill Common-wealth, ſo alſo it cannot be taken away from them but by Ciuill authority. And therefore thoſe <hi>Canons</hi> either of <hi>Popes</hi> or <hi>Councels,</hi> wherein children are exempted from the power, and authoritie, which by the Ciuill law their Parents haue ouer them, doe either confirme that which was firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed by the Imperiall law, or they are made with the expreſſe or tacite conſent of <hi>temporall Princes;</hi> or they doe onely declare the law of God and nature, to wit, that children are to forſake the company of their Parents, when by conuerſing with them they are in danger to offend their Creatour. As when the Father is accounted to be dead <hi>ciuilly</hi> (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſome great ſinne committed by him, as hereſie, and treaſon, or otherwiſe, or if he make profeſſion in an approued Religion, whereby he is accounted dead to the world) his Children are diſcharged by the <hi>Ciuill law</hi> from the power which he had ouer them, as you may ſee in <hi>Molina,</hi> in the place whereto my <hi>Aduerſary</hi> remitteth his reader. For it is a rule of the Ciuill law that <hi>naturall</hi> and <hi>ciuill</hi> death are equiualent concerning <hi>ciuill</hi> acts, as noteth the <hi>Gloſſe</hi> vpon Leg. <hi>ſi deceſſerit. ff. qui ſatiſdare.</hi> So likewiſe, if one be ordained a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> he is diſcharged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by from the power and authority which his <hi>Father</hi> hath ouer him, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thent.</hi> de Sanct. Epiſcopis, cap. 3. §. <hi>Si uero contigerit.</hi> And in this particular caſe which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> here vrgeth, that decree of the fourth <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Toledo</hi> was made by the authority and conſent of King <hi>Siſennandus,</hi> as I haue ſhewed more at large in that <hi>Appendix</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Suarez.</hi> Beſides the decree of that Councell, if it be vnderſtood of <hi>Children</hi> which haue <hi>diſcretion,</hi> is onely a declaration, as I there ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, of the law of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> whereby the baptized children of <hi>Iewes</hi> are freed not from the power or right which <hi>Parents</hi> haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their Children, but onely from their company, for that the law of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> forbiddeth all conuerſation, whereby one may incurre probable danger of reuolting from the faith, or falling into any other ſinne.</p>
            <p n="95">95 And the like is to be ſaid of the diſcharge of ſlaues and bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men from the company of their Lords, when the ſaid ſlaues are Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, and their Lords heretikes. For although theſe ſlaues, if they be in danger to be peruerted, may by the law of <hi>God</hi> &amp; <hi>Nature</hi> abſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelus from the company of their Lords, vntil the danger be paſt: as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a catholike wife may depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the company of her husband who is an heretike, if ſhe be in danger of being peruerted by his company, &amp; this the Church hath power to declare, and command them vnder paine of ſpirituall Cenſures to performe: Neuertheleſſe the <hi>Church</hi> hath no authority to diſſolue the bond of Matrimony, or to take away
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:150436:157"/>
the right or fatherly power, which hereticall Parents haue ouer their Children, or to releaſe the bond of ſlauery, by which Lords haue a right or dominion ouer their ſlaues. And therefore when the danger of being peruerted is paſt, the wife is bound to returne to her Husband, the Child to his Father, and the bondman to his Lord, vnleſſe, by the authority of the <hi>temporall Prince,</hi> the Childe bee freed, from the right and power which his Father had ouer him, and the ſlaue from his bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.

For becauſe as well temporall as ſpirituall puniſhments may be vertuous, or vicious actions, therefore they are proportionate to the ſpirituall <hi>directiue</hi> power, whoſe proper acts, and obiects are the commanding of vertue, and the forbidding of vice, but becauſe not the commanding either of temporall or ſpirituall puniſhments, but only the actuall puniſhing with Eccleſiaſticall cenſures, or the inflicting of ſpirituall puniſhments, is the proper act, and obiect of the ſpirituall <hi>coerciue</hi> power, therefore
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:150436:161"/>
the inflicting onely of ſpirituall puniſhments, and not of temporall is proportionate to the ſpirituall <hi>coerciue</hi> power. From whence it eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently followeth, that the Church for a ſpirituall end may command temporall things, but not diſpoſe of temporall things: may command one to giue Almes for the ſatisfaction of his ſinnes, but may not take away his purſe from him to giue Almes for that end, may commaund one to puniſh and macerate his body, when it rebelleth againſt the ſoule, but not inflict vpon him corporall puniſhments for the ſame end.</p>

               <hi>how my Aduerſarie</hi> Widdrington <hi>proceedeth, who hauing giuen his reaſon (though ſo weake as you haue heard) why hee thinketh it to bee againſt reaſon, that a ſpirituall Superiour ſhould puniſh tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally, vndertaketh to anſwere one place onely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged by me out of the old law, and foure out of the new, omitting to ſay any thing elſe in particular to all the other places, and arguments, which I vrged out of the law of God, and Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 But <hi>first</hi> it is not true, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> ſaith, that I gaue any reaſon at all, why I thought it to <hi>bee againſt</hi> reaſon, that a ſpirituall Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:150436:163"/>
ſhould puniſh temporally, for I neuer thought this to bee <hi>againſt</hi> naturall reaſon. That which I affirmed onely was, that true reaſon doeth teach, that euery Superiour hath power to puniſh his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect with ſome puniſhment proportionate to his authoritie, to wit, by depriuing him of thoſe goods, which are proper to that Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, whereof hee is Superiour; but that any other Superiour beſides the ſupreame Gouernour of the ciuill common-wealth hath power to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh his ſubiects with death, mayming, or depriuation of temporall goods, it cannot bee deduced from the neceſſarie rule, or preſcript of true reaſon; This was that I ſaid: Now what man of learning that knoweth the difference betwixt <hi>contra naturam, ſecundu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> naturam, praeter</hi> and <hi>ſupra naturam,</hi> that is, <hi>againſt nature, according to nature, beſides and aboue nature,</hi> would affirme, that becauſe I thinke, it cannot bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> or the preſcript of true naturall reaſon, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> pretended to prooue, that a ſpirituall Superiour may puniſh temporally, therefore I muſt thinke, that it is <hi>againſt Nature</hi> that a ſpirituall Superiour may puniſh temporally; as though this propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>It cannot bee prooued by the</hi> law <hi>of</hi> Nature, <hi>that a ſpirituall Superiour may puniſh temporally,</hi> doth according to his logicke neceſſarily inferre, that therefore <hi>it is againſt the law of Nature that a ſpirituall Superiour may puniſh temporally.</hi> For I make no doubt, but that <hi>Christ</hi> our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our might if it had pleaſed him, haue giuen authoritie, as I am fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded hee hath not, to ſpirituall Paſtours to puniſh temporally, and ſo in this caſe hee had granted nothing <hi>againſt</hi> the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> or <hi>againſt</hi> the preſcript of true naturall reaſon, but only <hi>aboue</hi> Nature, and the light of naturall reaſon, yet in this caſe it could not bee prooued by the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> but only by the <hi>poſitiue inſtitution,</hi> and <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that ſpirituall Paſtours haue authoritie to puniſh temporally. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> hath neither commanded, nor forbidden, hath neither giuen, nor denyed to ſpirituall Paſtours authoritie to puniſh temporally, but if they haue any ſuch authoritie, it muſt be giuen them by the poſitiue grant of GOD, or man, and conſequently it is neither <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt,</hi> nor <hi>according,</hi> but <hi>aboue,</hi> or <hi>beſides</hi> the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> that ſpiritual Paſtors ſhould haue any ſuch authoritie to puniſh temporally.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>Secondly,</hi> the reaſon why I omitted to ſay ſomething in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to euery part of his <hi>idle</hi> Diſcourſe in this <hi>Reply</hi> of his, but anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red onely ſome certaine arguments drawne from thoſe <hi>ſixe</hi> generall heads, to wit, from the <hi>old law,</hi> and the <hi>new,</hi> the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>nations,</hi> the <hi>Canon,</hi> and the <hi>Ciuill law,</hi> was not for that I could not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere particularly euery one of them, as the <hi>Reader</hi> may ſee by this Treatiſe, wherein I haue anſwered his whole <hi>Reply,</hi> and euery part thereof; but the reaſon was, for that neither the breuitie of ſuch a ſhort <hi>Admonition,</hi> nor the <hi>Printer,</hi> who had then finiſhed the whole <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,</hi>
               <pb n="292" facs="tcp:150436:164"/>
would hardly permit me to make ſo long a <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> as there I made, and therfore I choſe out of purpoſe certaine arguments drawne from each one of thoſe <hi>ſixe</hi> ſeuerall heads, which I thought to bee the ſtrongeſt, and which being anſwered, the iudicious <hi>Reader</hi> might eaſily perceiue how all the reſt might in the like maner be fully ſatisfied.</p>

For if you note well what</hi> Widdrington <hi>ſaith, and inferreth, he prooueth nothing elſe, but that the penalty of temporall or corporall death is not now inflicted in the new Teſtament, as it was in the old, and that the ſame is now turned to the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall death of the ſoule by</hi> Excommunication, <hi>which we denie not. But will he inferre hereupon, that therefore the</hi> Church <hi>cannot now inflict other tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall penalties? So ſhould he make a very abſurd inference, eſpecially ſeeing that the penalty of</hi> Excommunication, <hi>which, as he himſelfe granted, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth the place of corporall death, includeth a temporall puniſhment by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the delinquent from the conuerſation of men, and from diuers other temporall commodities, as I haue ſhewed in the laſt Chapter</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">
                  <hi>Num.</hi> 18.</note>.</p>
            <p n="6">6 But truely I cannot but ſmile to ſee the vanitie of this man, who though he ſee himſelfe altogether vanquiſhed, yet he boaſteth that hee is victorious, and although he clearely perceiueth, yea, and almoſt expreſſely confeſſeth, that his argument taken from the words of <hi>Deuteronomie</hi> the 17.

<pb n="293" facs="tcp:150436:164"/>
fortified, and ſtrengthened. For if you note well what he granteth, to wit, <hi>That the penalty of corporall death is not now inflicted in the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as it was in the olde, and that the ſame is now turned to the ſpirituall death of the ſoule by excommunication,</hi> you cannot but clearely ſee that his argument taken from <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> the 17. Chapter, which onely text in particular I vndertooke to anſwere, and which ſpeaketh onely of <hi>corporall death,</hi> is quite ouerthrowne: and yet, <hi>forſooth,</hi> I doe <hi>hereby rather fortifie and ſtrengthen, then weaken or hurt any way his cauſe:</hi> By which you may plainely perceiue what credit is to be giuen to the reſt of his vaine-glorious brags, ſeeing that in this ſo manifeſt an ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of his argument, taken from the words of <hi>Deuteronomie</hi> the 17. he is not aſhamed to boaſt that I haue rather fortified and ſtrengthened then weakened or hurt any way his cauſe. <hi>But will</hi> Widdrington, ſaith he, <hi>inferre hereupon, that therefore the Church cannot now inflict other tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall penalties? So ſhould he make a very abſurd inference, eſpecially, ſeeing that the penalty of Excommunication includeth a temporall puniſhment, &amp;c.</hi> The inference that <hi>Widdrington</hi> maketh is, that from the wordes of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> the 17. which ſpeake onely of corporall death, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herbert</hi> hath brought no good argument; for that according to the doctrine of Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> which hee himſelfe alſo will not denie, <hi>The penalty of corporall death is now in the new law turned to the death of the ſoule by Excommunication.</hi> Neither is it true, that <hi>Excommunication,</hi> being of it own nature a <hi>ſeparation fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall conuerſation of the faithfull,</hi> doth of it <hi>owne nature</hi> include any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall puniſhment at all, as alſo I haue ſhewed in the laſt Chapter, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it I doe not denie that the <hi>Church</hi> hath now by way of command, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to <hi>Excommunication</hi> ſome temporall penalties, but not by way of <hi>inflicting</hi> them, as I declared in that place, for I euer granted that the <hi>Church</hi> hath power to command, enioyne, or impoſe temporall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but not to inflict them: yet theſe to <hi>command,</hi> and to <hi>inflict,</hi> to <hi>impoſe,</hi> and to <hi>dispoſe,</hi> my <hi>Aduerſary</hi> doth commonly confound.</p>

               <hi>it is euident, that in the olde Teſtament euen the temporall Princes themſelues were puniſhed by depriuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their right to their temporall states, and dominions as</hi>

               <hi>at large. And therefore ſeeing he telleth vs how the penalty of corporall death (which was ordained in the olde Teſtament) is now fulfilled spiritually in the new; let him alſo tell vs, to what ſpirituall puniſhment the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:150436:165"/>
depriuation of</hi> Princes <hi>right to their ſtates, and other temporall penalties then vſuall, are now conuerted, to the end that wee may ſee the correſpondence of the</hi> figure <hi>to the</hi> veritie <hi>in matters of puniſhment and in the meane time let him acknowledge, according to his owne doctrine, and inſtance here produced, that the</hi> Church <hi>may puniſh temporally, ſeeing it may excommunicate and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently depriue men of many temporall commodities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8 But this alſo is very vntrue, that the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of the <hi>olde Teſtament</hi> had authoritie to puniſh temporall <hi>Princes,</hi> by depriuing them of their right to their temporall ſtates, and dominions, as I amply prooued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue in the 5. Chapter. Neither doe theſe examples, brought here by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert,</hi> prooue any ſuch thing. For to the examples of King <hi>Ozias</hi> and <hi>Athalia,</hi> I haue anſwered aboue at large. And as for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>two,</hi> beſides that <hi>Samuel, Elias,</hi> and <hi>Elizeus,</hi> were not <hi>Priests,</hi> it is manifeſt, that what they did concerning the annointing, or depoſing of any <hi>King,</hi> they did it not by their owne authority, but onely as <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> and ſpeciall meſſengers ſent by God to that purpoſe. <hi>How long</hi> (ſaith God to <hi>Samuel</hi>)<note n="i" place="margin">1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 16.</note> 
               <hi>dost thou mourne</hi> Saul, <hi>whom I haue reiected, that hee rule not ouer Iſrael? Fill thy horne with oyle, and come, that I may ſend thee to</hi> Iſai <hi>the Bethleemite, for I haue prouided me a King among his Sons.</hi> And again, <hi>Goe,</hi> (ſaith God to<note n="k" place="margin">3 <hi>Reg.</hi> 19.</note> 
               <hi>Elias) and returne into thy way by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert of</hi> Damaſcus, <hi>and when thou art come thither, thou ſhalt annoint</hi> Haza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el <hi>King ouer</hi> Syria, <hi>and</hi> Iehu <hi>the Sonne of</hi> Namſi <hi>thou ſhalt annoint King o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and</hi> Elizeus <hi>the Sonne of</hi> Saphat, <hi>thou ſhalt annoynt Prophet for thee.</hi> And therefore he that was ſent by <hi>Elizeus</hi> to annoint <hi>Iehu,</hi> was commanded to ſpeake in the perſon of <hi>God,</hi> &amp; not of <hi>Elizeus; And hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> (ſaith<note n="l" place="margin">4 <hi>Reg.</hi> 9.</note>

Belike M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert,</hi> will approoue alſo this argument, that becauſe <hi>Elias</hi> was commanded by God to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint not onely <hi>Iehu</hi> King ouer <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but alſo <hi>Hazael</hi> King ouer <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> therefore the <hi>Pope</hi> hath authority to make, and depoſe, not onely <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> but alſo <hi>Pagan</hi> Kings.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Wherefore that demand, which is heere made by my <hi>Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, to what ſpirituall puniſhment the depriuation of</hi> Princes <hi>right to their States, and other temporall penalties then vſuall, are now conuerted, to the end wee may ſee the correſpondence of the</hi> figure <hi>to the</hi> veritie <hi>in matters of puniſhment,</hi> is friuolous; both for that the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of the <hi>old</hi> law had no authority to depriue <hi>Kings</hi> of their temporall States, and Dominions, or to inflict temporall puniſhments; and alſo albeit they had ſuch an
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:150436:165"/>
authority, neuertheleſſe it could not bee prooued from thence, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing an argument from the <hi>figure</hi> to the <hi>veritie,</hi> that therefore the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of the <hi>new</hi> law muſt haue authoritie to doe the like, but things farre more noble, and excellent, for that the <hi>veritie</hi> muſt be of a more high and excellent order, then the <hi>figure,</hi> as in the fifth Chapter I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued more at large. And therefore as in the <hi>olde</hi> law all the figures, promiſes, and puniſhments were temporall, ſo in the <hi>new</hi> law the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, promiſes, and puniſhments, which correſpond thereunto, muſt be ſpirituall, not temporall, for otherwiſe the <hi>figure</hi> ſhould bee the ſame with the <hi>veritie,</hi> and not of an higher nature, and order then the <hi>verity:</hi> So that temporall life, muſt correſpond to ſpirituall life, temporall kingdomes to ſpirituall kingdomes, temporall goods to ſpirituall goods, temporall promiſes, and rewards to ſpirituall promiſes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and temporall puniſhments to ſpirituall puniſhments; all which ſpirituall puniſhments are contained in <hi>Excommunication Maior,</hi> and <hi>Minor,</hi> and in other Eccleſiaſticall Cenſures and puniſhments. And to that, which he addeth in the end, <hi>that I muſt acknowledge according to my owne doctrine, that the Church may puniſh temporally, ſeeing that ſhee may excommunicate,</hi> I haue already fully<note n="m" place="margin">Cap.</note> anſwered, and denyed his conſequence, for that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> neither by <hi>Exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication,</hi> nor by any other way, hath by the inſtitution of <hi>Chriſt</hi> authoritie to inflict temporall puniſhments, but only to puniſh temporally by way of <hi>command,</hi> which no man denyeth. And thus much concerning the <hi>olde</hi> law.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Now to the authorities, which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> brought out of the <hi>new</hi> Teſtament, I anſwered thus: <hi>Sixtly,</hi> thoſe places of the <hi>new</hi> Teſtament, <hi>Quodcunque ſolueris ſuper terram,</hi> &amp;c.<note n="n" place="margin">Matth. 16.</note>

            <p>True it is, that although I did not in that place expreſly affirme, as alſo I did not deny, that the Eccleſiaſticall power doth not extend to the abſoluing from oathes, and vowes, yet of ſet purpoſe, and for ſome myſterie I did then omit to make mention of them: and the myſterie was this, for that there is a great controuerſie among learned <hi>Diuines,</hi> eſpecially betwixt the <hi>Thomiſts,</hi> and their oppoſites; (wherewith I thought it neither neceſſarie, nor expedient at that time to intermeddle) not only in what maner the ſpiritual power of the <hi>Church</hi> may abſolue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> oaths, &amp; vowes, but alſo whether the <hi>Church</hi> hath any authoritie at all to abſolue from all Oaths, and all vowes, ſeeing that, as afterwards<note n="m" place="margin">Praefat. <hi>ad</hi> Reſp.

            </p>
            <p n="49">49 <hi>The</hi> firſt <hi>is, whether any authority were left by</hi> Chriſt <hi>in his</hi> Church, <hi>and Chriſtian Common-wealth to reſtraine, or repreſſe, cenſure or iudge any exorbitant, and pernicious exceſſe of great men, States, or</hi> Princes, <hi>or that he hath left them remedileſſe wholy by any ordinarie authoritie?</hi> And to this queſtion the ſubſtance of his anſwere is this; <hi>that as in all other common-wealths that are not Chriſtian, all Philoſophers, and other men of ſoundeſt wiſedome, prudence, and experience, either</hi> Iew, <hi>or</hi> Gentile <hi>haue from the beginning of the world concurred in this, that</hi> God <hi>and nature hath left ſome ſufficient authoritie in euery common-wealth for the lawfull and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly repreſſing of thoſe euils euen in the higheſt perſons. So when</hi> Chriſt <hi>our Sauiour came to found his</hi> Common-wealth <hi>of Chriſtians in farre more perfection then other ſtates had beene eſtabliſhed before, ſubiecting temporall things to ſpirituall, according to the degree of their natures ends, and eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and appointing a ſupreme vniuerſall</hi> Gouernour <hi>in the one, with a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall charge to looke to all his ſheepe, without exception of great, or ſmall, people or potentates: vpon theſe ſuppoſitions (I ſay) all Catholike learned men doe ground and haue euer grounded, that in Chriſtian Common-wealthes, not only the foreſaid ordinary authoritie is left, which euery other ſtate, and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome had by</hi> God, <hi>and nature to preſerue, and protect themſelues in the caſes before laid down; but further alſo for more ſure, &amp; orderly proceeding therin, that the ſupreme care, iudgement, direction, and cenſure of this matter was left principally by</hi> Chriſt <hi>our Sauiour vnto the ſaid</hi> ſupreme Gouernour, <hi>and</hi> Paſtour <hi>of his</hi> Church <hi>and Common-wealth. And in this there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in opinion, or beliefe betweene any ſort of</hi> Catholikes <hi>whatſoeuer (ſo they be</hi> Catholikes) <hi>though in particular caſes, diuerſitie of perſons, time, place, cauſe, and other circumstances, may mooue ſome diuerſitie of opinions.

            </p>
            <p n="50">50 <hi>The ſecond</hi> queſtion <hi>may bee about the manner how this authoritie, or in what ſort it was giuen by Chriſt to his ſaid</hi> ſupreme Paſtour, <hi>whether directly or indirectly, immediately, or by a certaine conſequence.</hi> And to this <hi>queſtion</hi> he anſwereth: <hi>that albeit the Canoniſts doe commonly defend the first part, and</hi> Catholike Diuines <hi>for the moſt part the</hi> ſecond; <hi>yet both parts fully agree, that there is ſuch an authoritie left by</hi> Chriſt <hi>in his</hi> Church, <hi>for remedie of vrgent caſes, for that otherwiſe hee ſhould not haue ſufficiently prouided for the neceſſitie thereof.

            </p>
            <p n="61">61 To this argument I anſwered, that the power to inflict Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall Cenſures, being conſidered <hi>in it ſelfe,</hi> is <hi>ſufficient</hi> to ſaue ſoules, and that Eccleſiaſticall Cenſures being ſo dreadfull puniſhments, as I haue ſhewed, are <hi>of themſelues ſufficient,</hi> if they meete with a capable ſubiect, to withdraw men from ſinne; neither is it <hi>neceſſarie,</hi> that the <hi>Church</hi> muſt haue, beſides a power <hi>ſufficient of it ſelfe, ſufficient force,</hi> might, and effectuall meanes to withdraw men <hi>actually</hi> from ſinne, for this were extreame folly to ſay as my <hi>Aduerſarie</hi> himſelfe confeſſeth; <hi>For the ſufficiencie,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>of the power, which</hi> Chriſt <hi>hath left to his</hi> Church <hi>in this point, or any other conſiſteth in this, that the power being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in it ſelfe, is ſufficient to worke the effect, for which it was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, if it meete with a capable ſubiect, and haue no externall impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Wherefore it is manifeſt, that hee who will contend, that the <hi>Church</hi> muſt haue a more <hi>ſufficient power</hi> to ſaue ſoules, then which <hi>of it ſelfe is ſufficient if it meete with a capable ſubiect, and haue no externall impediment,</hi> muſt needes ſuppoſe that the <hi>Church</hi> muſt alſo haue <hi>ſufficient force,</hi> might, and effectuall meanes to ſaue ſoules and a power to make the ſubiect capable, and to remooue all external,

impediments, or, which is all one, muſt haue ſuch a ſufficient power, which is not onely ſufficient in regard of the power being conſidered in it ſelfe, but alſo in regard of all other things, which are neceſſarie that the power worke the effect, for which it was ordained: for that theſe <hi>two</hi> are oppoſite parts or members of the diſtinction I made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and no man that hath any skill in <hi>Logike</hi> can be ignorant, that in euery diuiſion conſiſting only of <hi>two</hi> parts, or members, we may right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly argue from the affirming of the one part to the denyall of the other, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the denying of the one to the affirming of the other. If therfore the power of the <hi>Church</hi> to inflict <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> Cenſures be <hi>of it ſelfe a ſufficient coerciue power</hi> to withdraw men from ſinne, which is the end of Eccleſiaſticall power, and if men bee not thereby withdrawne from ſinne, it is not by reaſon of the inſufficiencie of the power, but of the indiſpoſition of the ſubiect, no other <hi>coerciue power</hi> to inflict temporall puniſhments can be <hi>neceſſarie:</hi> And therefore the aforeſaid diſtinction of Eccleſiaſticall <hi>coerciue</hi> power conſidered in it ſelfe; and in reſpect of the impediments, which may be in regard of the ſubiect, did quite ouerthrow Cardinall <hi>Bellarmines ſecond argument,</hi> and the whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Fa. <hi>Parſons,</hi> which was grounded thereon.

               <hi>that any man of iudgement can thinke it vnlawfull for the ſupreme ſpirituall Paſtour, to puniſh his ſheepe, or ſubiects in their bodies, or goods, ſeeing that it cannot be denied, but that he is their Paſtour, and ſuperiour in regard not onely of their ſoules, but alſo of their bodies, that is to ſay, of their whole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons wherein their bodie is neceſſarily included; and therefore for as much as
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:150436:184"/>
euery man is bound to ſerue</hi> God <hi>no leſſe with his body, then with his ſoule, and that the body concurreth with the ſoule to the execution of all externall workes, good and bad, and ſhall be either glorified, or tormented eternally toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with it, no man can with reaſon denie, but that he who hath the direction, and gouernement of the whole perſon for the eternall good thereof, may puniſh the ſame as well in the one part, as in the other (as alſo in what elſe ſoeuer is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſorie to the ſaid perſon) when the ſame ſhall be requiſite for the eternall good, and ſaluation thereof.

And this I hope, may ſuffice for the confutation of</hi> Widdringtons <hi>anſweres concerning the law of</hi> God, <hi>and</hi> Nature; <hi>and therefore I will now briefly examine, what he ſaith concerning the law of</hi> Nations, <hi>and the</hi> Ciuill, <hi>or</hi> Imperiall law, <hi>which ſhall be the ſubiect of the next Chapter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="81">81 But truely I cannot but wonder, that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert,</hi> who is taken, and commended by many for a man, although not of any great Schoole-learning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet of a deepe, and rare naturall iudgement, ſhould ſo palpably bewray both his want of learning, and alſo his weakeneſſe of iudgement. For by his owne argument any man of iudgement may conclude, that a <hi>temporall Prince</hi> may puniſh his ſubiects not onely in their bodies and goods, but alſo in their ſoules: ſeeing that it cannot be denied, but that he is their Superiour in regard not onely of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but alſo of their ſoules, that is to ſay, of their whole <hi>perſons,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their ſoule is neceſſarily included; and therefore for as much as eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Chriſtian man is bound to ſerue his <hi>temporall Prince,</hi> and obey his iuſt lawes, no leſſe with his ſoule and for conſcience ſake, then with his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and that the ſoule concurreth with the body to the execution of all externall workes, good and bad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſhall be either glorified, or tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented eternally together with it, no man can with reaſon denie; but that hee who hath the direction and gouernement of the <hi>whole perſon</hi> for the temporall good thereof, and the publike good of the whole common-wealth, may puniſh the ſame as well in the one part, as the other (as alſo in what elſe ſoeuer is <hi>acceſſorie</hi> to the ſaid <hi>perſon</hi>) when the ſame ſhall be requiſite for the temporall good of the ſaid <hi>perſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and the publike good of the whole common-weath. So as reaſon it ſelfe may teach vs, that temporall authoritie extendeth it ſelfe to the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not onely of the body, but alſo of the ſoule, when occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth.</p>
            <p n="82">82 Now what will M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> in his iudgement ſay to this argument? Can he denie, that a temporall <hi>Prince</hi> is not Superiour to euery <hi>perſon,</hi> that is ſubiect to the lawes of his kingdome? Or can hee deny, that when a temporall <hi>Prince</hi> commaundeth his ſubiects to doe any thing, that part which is principally commaunded, is the ſoule,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:150436:184"/>
which is capable of reaſon, and therefore chiefly ſubiect to command, and not the bodie, which is not endued with reaſon? for which cauſe neither the ſoule, if it want the vſe of reaſon, is ſubiect to command, as it appeareth in infants, and mad men, who although they ſhould kill a man, doe no more tranſgreſſe the law made againſt murther, then if a wild beaſt ſhould doe the ſame: And therefore it cannot be denied, but that as well a temporall <hi>Prince</hi> in order to temporall good, as a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall <hi>Paſtour</hi> in order to ſpirituall good is ſuperiour to the whole <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> of man, although the ſoule, which is capable of reaſon, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and not the body, is chiefly ſubiect to the commandement as well of temporall <hi>Princes</hi> in order to temporall good, as of ſpirituall <hi>Pastours</hi> in order to the ſpirituall, and eternall good of their ſoules. <hi>Moreouer</hi> a Chriſtian <hi>Prince</hi> is to direct, and gouerne by temporall lawes the <hi>perſons</hi> committed to his charge, not onely for their tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall good, but alſo for their ſpirituall, and eternall: for that the end of a Chriſtian <hi>Prince</hi> is, alſo according to Card, <hi>Bellarmines</hi> doctrine,<note n="ſ" place="margin">

               </gap>, the weakeneſſe of this argument will cleerely appeare, and the confuſed, and cloudie miſt of the <hi>Popes</hi> Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioritie ouer the whole <hi>perſon</hi> of euery Chriſtian man, which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> for want either of learning, and iudgement, or of ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hath caſt before the eyes of the vnlearned <hi>Readers,</hi> will be eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed, and their vnderſtandings cleered, if they diſtinguiſh betwixt the <hi>directiue,</hi> or commanding, and the <hi>coerciue,</hi> or puniſhing power both of temporall <hi>Princes,</hi> and alſo of ſpirituall <hi>Pastours.</hi> For to omit now Metaphiſicall queſtions (as in what conſiſteth eſſentially the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> of man, and how the <hi>perſon</hi> of man is diſtinguiſhed from his huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, or which is all one, from the body and ſoule of man being vnited in one eſſentiall compound, and whether the ſubſiſtence, or perſonali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of man be a ſimple, or compound entitie, a ſpirituall, or corporall, or mixt of both, for if it be a ſimple entitie, we cannot properly ſay the whole <hi>perſon</hi> of man, as though the perſonality of man were compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of parts, which difficulties the vulgar ſort cannot well compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend) and to take the whole <hi>perſon</hi> of man in the common vulgar ſenſe,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:150436:185"/>
as it is a particular, or indiuiduall ſubſtance, including both body and ſoule, it is euident, that the ſoule of man is, if not onely, yet principally ſubiect to the <hi>directiue</hi> or commanding power, not onely of ſpirituall <hi>Paſtours,</hi> but alſo of temporall <hi>Princes,</hi> for that lawes are not made but for reaſonable creatures, and who haue free will to obſerue or tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe the law. And therefore although a temporall <hi>Prince</hi> hath power to force or puniſh the bodies of his ſubiects, yet he cannot command their bodies, becauſe they are not capable of reaſon or vnderſtanding.</p>
            <p n="84">84 But we muſt not argue in the like manner concerning the <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciue,</hi> or puniſhing power. For, conſidering that not onely the ſoule, but alſo the body are ſubiect to puniſhments, according to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to wit, the ſoule to ſpirituall, and the body to temporall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, therefore as well the body as the ſoule are ſubiect to the <hi>coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciue,</hi> or puniſhing power in generall, according as it may inflict corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall or ſpirituall puniſhments. Wherefore, neither from the ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or authority, which ſpirituall <hi>Paſtours</hi> haue to direct or commaund the <hi>perſons</hi> of their ſpirituall ſubiects, nor from the authority which temporall <hi>Princes</hi> haue to direct or command the <hi>perſons</hi> of their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall ſubiects, can we rightly conclude, what authority either ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all <hi>Paſtours,</hi> or temporall <hi>Princes</hi> haue to puniſh the ſoule, or the body, or, which is all one, to inflict ſpirituall or temporall puniſhments: for that the ſoule, and not the body is principally ſubiect to the <hi>directiue</hi> or commanding power. So that by this manner of arguing from the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectiue</hi> power to the <hi>coerciue,</hi> it may rather be concluded, that tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Princes</hi> may puniſh the ſoule, for that they haue power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the ſoule, rather then that ſpirituall <hi>Paſtours</hi> may puniſh the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, for that they haue not power to commaund the body, which being an vnreaſonable creature, is not ſubiect to any externall commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But what <hi>coerciue</hi> authority either ſpirituall <hi>Pastours,</hi> or tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Princes</hi> haue to puniſh the body or ſoule, wee muſt gather from the inſtitution of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to wit, whether <hi>Christ</hi> our Sauiour hath giuen au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to ſpirituall Paſtours to inflict onely ſpirituall puniſhments, and conſequently to puniſh onely the ſoule, and to temporall <hi>Princes</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict onely corporall and temporall puniſhments, and conſequently to puniſh onely the body, and not the ſoule, but onely by conſequence as being grieued when the body either in it ſelfe, or in ſome temporall things annexed therunto, is puniſhed. So that the maine queſtion, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherberts</hi> argument, ſtill remaineth a foote to wit, whether <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Sauiour hath giuen to ſpirituall <hi>Paſtours</hi> authority to inflict onely ſpirituall, or alſo temporall puniſhments; neither can this queſtion bee decided by any argument grounded vpon naturall reaſon, but only vpon the holy Scriptures, wherein the inſtitution and law of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is contained.</p>

               <p>VVherein M. <hi>Fitzherberts</hi> arguments taken from the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nations</hi> and the <hi>Ciuill Law</hi> are anſwered: and <hi>firſt</hi> the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of the <hi>olde</hi> and <hi>New</hi> Teſtament, and the Priests of other Nations, and alſo betwixt the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nations,</hi> and of <hi>Nature</hi> is declared, and from thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that among all Nations the Ciuill Common-wealth was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame, and diſpoſed of all things both ſpirituall, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, and puniſhed all perſons both Prieſtes and others with temporall puniſhments: and conſequently that the new Oath cannot bee impugned by the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nations:</hi> and lastly what Maister <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> obiecteth from the <hi>Ciuill Law</hi> is confuted.</p>

            <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a vſuall tricke of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert,</hi> as you haue ſeene in the former <hi>Chapters,</hi> and alſo ſhall ſee in this, and the reſt, then moſt of all to bragge, when hee hath leaſt cauſe, and when any anſwere of mine is moſt ſound, and ſufficient, then to crie out that it is <hi>improbable, impertinent abſurd, friuolous, fooliſh, idle,</hi> or <hi>ridiculous.</hi> Hee pretended <hi>to prooue in his Supplement by the law of Nations, that the new Oath is vnlawfull in regard it denyeth the</hi> Popes <hi>power to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, and depoſe temporall Princes, not for that hee thought it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe needefull, hauing,</hi> as hee ſaith, <hi>prooued already</hi> (but how inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently you haue ſeene) <hi>that the Oath is contrarie to the law of God, and Nature, but to ſatisfie the importunitie of his Aduerſarie, and to giue his Reader an aboundant ſatisfaction, becauſe as the Lawyers ſay,</hi> abundans cautela non nocet, <hi>a prouiſo too much neuer hurteth.</hi> And to all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments he brought from the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Nations,</hi> and the <hi>Ciuill law,</hi> I gaue this briefe anſwere as heere hee ſetteth it downe.</p>

                  <hi>Septimò, ex iure Gentium nihil aliud probat hic Author, &amp;c. Seuenthly,</hi> this <hi>Authour</hi> prooueth nothing elſe by the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> but that all people euer held Religion in the higheſt price, or eſteeme, and preferred it before policie; but that the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had power, as they were <hi>Prieſts,</hi> to puniſh any man with death, or the depriuation of all his goods, it did not proceede from the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi>
               </hi> granting them ſuch an authoritie but from the municipall lawes of the Gentiles,<note place="margin">Pro <hi>domo</hi> ſua.</note> the which <hi>Cicero</hi> (whom this <hi>Authour</hi> citeth) doth moſt manifeſtly confirme, ſaying, <q>
                  <hi>that it was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinely inuented, and ordained by the ancient</hi> Romans, <hi>that their</hi> Biſhops <hi>ſhould haue the chiefe command both in matters belonging to the Common-wealth, and to the religion of the immortall Gods.</hi>
               </q> And as for the <hi>Ciuill</hi> law, this <hi>Authour</hi> onely confirmeth by it that the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is the ſupreame Gouernour of the <hi>Church</hi> in ſpirituall things. Thus I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in that briefe <hi>Admonition.</hi>

            <p n="3">3 Now M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> to this my Anſwere maketh as you ſhall ſee, no other Reply, then that, which I did fully ſatiſfie aboue in the <hi>ſixt</hi> Chapter, when I treated of the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Nature:</hi> and therefore it were needeleſſe to ſet downe heere his wordes <hi>verbatim,</hi> but that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe hee would take occaſion to bragge after his accuſtomed manner, that I haue concealed, and diſſembled his ſtrongeſt arguments.

               <hi>well noted,</hi> good Reader, <hi>what was the effect, and ſubstance of my diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the law of</hi> Nature <hi>thou wilt eaſily diſcouer the weakeneſſe of this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere. For whereas hee would prooue by</hi> Cicero <hi>his wordes alleadged by me, that the authoritie of the</hi> Pagan Prieſts <hi>to puniſh the ſupreame Secular</hi> Magiſtrates <hi>with death, or depriuation of goods, proceeded not from the law of</hi> Nature, <hi>but from the municipall lawes of the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>I muſt deſire him to call to minde what was my inference vpon the wordes of</hi> Cicero, <hi>and the examples by mee alleadged; to wit, that this law, and cuſtome amongſt the</hi> Romans <hi>had no other ground in their opinion, but the</hi> Law <hi>of</hi> Nature, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they hauing no other light to guide them, but the light of reaſon, held it to bee most conforme to</hi> Nature, <hi>that religion ſhould bee preferred before poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and temporall things ſubordinate to ſpirituall, by the ſame reaſon that things leſſe perfect are inferiour to the more perfect, the body to the ſoule, earthly things to heauenly, men to Angels, and the like.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 <hi>So albeit I doe not deny but that their cuſtome proceeded from their municipall law, yet it doeth not follow thereon, that it did not alſo proceede from the</hi> Law <hi>of</hi> Nature, <hi>but rather the contrarie, becauſe their municipall law in that point had no other ground, but the</hi> Law <hi>of</hi> Nature, <hi>which moued them to make that</hi> Law. <hi>For although the</hi> Law <hi>of</hi> Nature <hi>could not teach them the myſteries of</hi> Chriſtian Religion. <hi>nor in what manner</hi> GOD <hi>was to be worſhipped, and ſerued, in which reſpect they both might, and did erre in
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:150436:187"/>
thoſe things, which pertained to particular points of religion, (as alſo other Nations did which had not the light of grace) yet not onely they, but alſo all other Nations, being enlightned by nature, agreed in certaine generall prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples touching religion, as concerning the neceſſitie, and dignitie thereof, and that all humane actions ought to bee leuelled, and referred thereto, as to their end; whereupon neceſſarily followed the ſubordination, and ſubiection of temporall things to ſpirituall, and of the Ciuill, or politicall Societie to the Religious in matters that touch religion: and all this I explicated further in my</hi> Supplement, <hi>when I treated of the law of</hi> Nations <hi>in particular, in theſe words.</hi> Thus M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5 Whereby <hi>firſt</hi> of all you may eaſily ſee, that all the proofes hee bringeth from the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Nations,</hi> he reduceth to the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> and that therefore what I ſaid in the <hi>ſixt</hi> Chapter concerning the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> doth fully ſatisfie all that hee ſaith heere concerning the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>nations.</hi> And <hi>ſecondly</hi> you may ſee, what a prettie circle hee maketh, and how cunningly he would prooue the ſame by the ſame. For in his <hi>ſixt</hi> Chapter hee pretended to prooue, that the authoritie of <hi>Pagan Prieſts</hi> to puniſh temporally the <hi>ſupreame Ciuill</hi> Magiſtrate did proceede from the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> for that it proceeded from the cuſtome and <hi>law</hi> of all <hi>Nations;</hi> and now heere hee prooueth, that this their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie did proceede from the cuſtome, and <hi>law</hi> of all <hi>Nations,</hi> for that it proceeded from the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> by which kinde of arguing hee prooueth in very deede <hi>idem per ſeipſum, the ſame thing by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6 Seeing therefore that all hee ſaith heere is a meere repetition of that hee ſaid in his <hi>ſixt</hi> Chapter, I will alſo reduce into a briefe <hi>compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> what I anſwered there, that the <hi>Reader</hi> may thereby cleerely ſee, that hee hath no way ſatisfied, albeit hee pretend to haue giuen an <hi>aboundant ſatisfaction</hi> to that which I anſwered in my briefe <hi>Admonition,</hi> as well concerning the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Nations,</hi> as <hi>Nature.</hi> And to take away all equiuocation and ambiguitie of wordes, although the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> doth <hi>properly</hi> ſignifie the light of naturall reaſon teaching or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing ſome thing of neceſſitie to bee done, or omitted, or, which is all one, commanding ſome thing to bee done, or not to bee done, for that euery <hi>law</hi> being taken <hi>properly</hi> doth <hi>intrinſecally</hi> include ſome precept, or commandement, neuertheleſſe wee doe not now take the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> in this <hi>proper,</hi> and ſtrict ſenſe, but more generally, for the light of naturall reaſon, not onely as it commandeth, or forbiddeth, but alſo as it giueth, granteth, teacheth or preſcribeth any thing, abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from all poſitiue lawes, grants, and ordinances of <hi>God,</hi> or man. So that euery right, power, or authoritie, which the light of naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, abſtracting from the poſitiue ordinances of God, or man, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to bee due, or belong to any man, is ſaid to belong to him by the
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:150436:187"/>
               <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> as the right which euery man hath to defend himſelfe and his goods, although it bee with the death of the inuader, is giuen him by the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>nature;</hi> Likewiſe the power, and authoritie, which the Ciuill common-wealth hath ouer euery member thereof, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the vnion of men in one Ciuill Societie, is granted by the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> for that the light of naturall reaſon, abſtracting from all poſitiue lawes, or graunts of GOD, or man, doeth teach, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine the ſame.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Now to the point, and to the inference, which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> made vpon the wordes of <hi>Cicero,</hi> and the examples by him alleadged; <hi>firſt,</hi> I did willingly grant, that the light of naturall reaſon doeth teach vs, that Religion is to bee preferred before pollicie, and temporall things are in perfection ſubordinate to ſpirituall, by the ſame reaſon that things leſſe perfect are inferiour to the more perfect, the body to the ſoule, earthly things to heauenly, men to Angels and the like; and that therefore when there are two things concurring, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to bee done, whereof the one concerneth religion, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the pollicie, the one ſpirituall things, the other temporall, the one concerneth the ſoule, the other the body, wee muſt preferre, <hi>cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris paribus,</hi> that which concerneth religion before that which concerneth pollicie, and that which concerneth ſpirituall things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that which concerneth temporall, and that which concerneth the ſoule before that, which concerneth the body: and this the light of true naturall reaſon doeth teach vs.</p>
            <p n="8">8 But what of all this? will hee conclude from hence, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Religious Prieſts</hi> are in perfection, and nobilitie ſuperiour to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall <hi>Princes</hi> by the ſame reaſon that policie is in perfection inferiour to Religion, therefore the light of naturall reaſon doeth teach vs, that <hi>Religious Prieſts</hi> may puniſh temporally <hi>temporall Princes,</hi> and are ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to them in temporall authoritie? This is a very vicious conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and by the like argument wee may conclude, that becauſe <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> are ſuperiour to men in perfection, and excellencie of ſubſtance, knowledge, and naturall ſtrength, therefore they are alſo ſuperiour to men in authoritie, and commaund, and that men are bound by force of obedience to doe what the <hi>Angells</hi> ſhall preſcribe, which no Diuine will grant, vnleſſe they bee ſent by GOD as his meſſengers, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. And likewiſe wee may conclude, that hee who hath one of the liberall ſciences, is by the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> ſuperiour in authoritie to euery trades man, by the ſame reaſon that things leſſe perfect are infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the more perfect, and euery ſeruile trade is ſubiect, and inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in perfection to euery one of the liberall arts: and yet whoſoeuer ſhould argue from the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> in this manner, would bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed to bee in this point no leſſe then a very naturall: for that
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:150436:188"/>
from the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> &amp; the light of naturall reaſon we can only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that in what degree of ſuperiority one thing is ſuperiour to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the like degree of ſubiection this is ſubiect, and ſubordinate to that, and that therefore temporall things are ſubiect to ſpirituall in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and perfection, becauſe theſe are ſuperiour to them herein; but to tranſcend from one kind of ſuperiority to another, and from ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority in perfection &amp; dignity, to argue a ſuperiority in command, and authority, or from a ſuperiority in ſpirituals, to argue a ſuperiority in meere temporall things, is contrary to the light and preſcript of true naturall reaſon.</p>
            <p n="9">9 <hi>Secondly,</hi> I did alſo graunt that all <hi>Nations</hi> being enlightened by <hi>Nature,</hi> did agree in certaine generall principles touching Religion, as concerning the neceſſity and dignity thereof, and that all humane acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ought to be leuelled and directed by the ſquare, and rule of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and referred thereto, as to the end of man, although not to the intrinſecall end of the actions themſelues, as I declared aboue in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part; whereupon doth neceſſarily follow a ſubordination and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection of temporall things, to ſpirituall, &amp; alſo of the ciuill Society to the religious in dignity and perfection: But it doth not follow from the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> or the light of naturall reaſon, that the <hi>religious Society,</hi> as it is diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>ciuill,</hi> ſhould haue power and authority to command and much leſſe to puniſh, eſpecially with temporall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, the <hi>ciuill Societie.</hi> And the reaſon hereof I alleaged in that place out of the doctrine of <hi>Abulenſis.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="10">10 Becauſe euery man liuing according to the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>nature;</hi> and the light of naturall reaſon may be conſidered, either as liuing by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alone, or elſe as liuing with other men in <hi>ciuill</hi> Society. If hee bee conſidered as liuing by himſelfe alone, what power ſoeuer hee hath ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concerning temporals or ſpirituals, concerning his body or ſoule, is in himſelfe alone, ſo that he hath neither power to command or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh but himſelfe alone; and in this manner euery man is a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and by the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> hath authority to worſhip <hi>God,</hi> and to ſacrifice to him in all places, and at all times, and with all kinde of Sacrifices, which the preſcript of true reaſon doth not teach to be vnlawfull, for that the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> or the light of naturall reaſon doth not limit, or determine to a man as liuing by himſelfe alone any certaine time, place, or maner of worſhipping <hi>God,</hi> and doing ſacrifice to him. But if a man be conſidered, as hee is a part and member of ſome <hi>ciuill</hi> Societie, or Common-wealth, then no priuate man, but the Common-wealth it ſelfe, or the ſupreame Gouernour thereof, hath by the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> and preſcript of naturall reaſon all authority to command, diſpoſe, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, and puniſh as well concerning religious as ciuill affaires: So that in this manner the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> it ſelfe, or the ſupreame Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:150436:188"/>
thereof is the <hi>publike Priest,</hi> and none hath authority to offer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to God, or to worſhip him in any publike manner, and as a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like perſon, but the Common-wealth it ſelfe, or thoſe, whom in her place ſhe ſhall appoint; neither can any priuate or particular man haue any publike authority to command, ordaine, or puniſh, for matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the worſhipping of God, but that which the ciuill Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth is pleaſed to grant him.</p>
            <p n="11">11 Wherefore there is a great difference, as I noted in that place, betwixt the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and the <hi>Religious</hi> Society in the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> before any poſitiue law of God was publiſhed, and the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>religious</hi> Society in the <hi>olde</hi> and <hi>new</hi> Teſtament. For in the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> there were not two diſtinct and independent <hi>Societies,</hi> the one <hi>Religious,</hi> the other <hi>Ciuill,</hi> but the <hi>ciuill</hi> Society had all power and authority to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and diſpoſe, as well concerning the publike ſeruice of God, as concerning ciuill gouernment; neither did the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> determine, or appoint any certaine men who ſhould be <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and ſhould haue full authority to commaund and diſpoſe of thoſe things which belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the publike ſeruice of God, but this authority was in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth it ſelfe, which appointed certaine men to be the <hi>publike</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, as well concerning the publike worſhipping of God, with reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious rites and ceremonies, as concerning the ciuill gouernment of the Common-wealth; neither had theſe <hi>publike</hi> miniſters any more autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or command, then the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> did giue them; ſo that it was in the power of the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> to extend, diminiſh, or quite take away the power, authority, command and priuiledges, which by her authority were granted vnto them. But ſince the poſitiue <hi>law</hi> of <hi>God</hi> was written, the <hi>religious</hi> and <hi>ciuill Societie</hi> are two totall and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>Common-wealths,</hi> neither hath the <hi>ciuill Common-wealth,</hi> or the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame Gouernours thereof any authority to determine matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning religion, and the <hi>publike</hi> ſeruice of Almighty God, for that hee himſelfe hath appointed thoſe that ſhall be <hi>publike</hi> Miniſters in matters belonging to Religion, to wit, in the <hi>olde Testament</hi> the ſonnes of <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> and who by naturall propagation ſhould deſcend from him, and in the <hi>new Teſtament</hi> his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and who by lawfull ordination ſhall deſcend from them, and what ſpirituall authority theſe Miniſters haue they doe not receiue from the <hi>ciuill Common-wealth,</hi> but from God himſelfe.</p>
            <p n="12">12 Whereupon it is euident, that we cannot gather what authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and priuiledges the <hi>Prieſts</hi> either of the <hi>olde Testament</hi> had, or of the <hi>new Teſtament</hi> haue, from the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> for that all the authoritie and priuiledges which the <hi>Prieſts</hi> in the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> had, did wholly depend vpon the <hi>ciuill Common-wealth,</hi> by whoſe authority thoſe <hi>Prieſts</hi> and Miniſters of religious rites and ceremonies were made, but
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:150436:189"/>
what authority either to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand or to puniſh either Lay-men, or Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie-men the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of the <hi>olde Teſtament</hi> had, and of the <hi>new Testament</hi> haue, we can onely gather from the poſitiue inſtitution, and graunt of God, who hath giuen and determined their authority, and not from the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> wherein the <hi>Prieſts</hi> were ſubiect to the <hi>ciuill Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,</hi> and had all their authority from the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> it ſelfe. And by this which I haue now ſaid here, and more at large de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the <hi>ſixt</hi> Chapter, is fully ſatisfied all that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> hath ſaid aboue, and repeateth heere out of his <hi>Supplement</hi> concerning the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> in theſe words:</p>

               <hi>it is to be conſidered, that humane law is commonly diuided into</hi> Ius Gentium, Ius Ciuile, <hi>and</hi> Ius Eccleſiaſticum <hi>vel</hi> Canonicum, the law of <hi>Nations,</hi> the <hi>Ciuill</hi> law, and the <hi>Canon</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> law. <hi>And as for the law of</hi> Nations <hi>(which is a humane law, ſo eaſily and directly deduced from the very principles of</hi> Nature, <hi>that all</hi> Nations <hi>doe receiue and admit it) it is manifest;</hi> &amp;c. But before wee goe any farther, it will not be amiſſe to obſerue the difference, which the learnedſt <hi>Diuines</hi> of this age doe make betwixt the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Nations</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> for vnleſſe wee know and agree what the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Nations</hi> is, we ſhall diſpute thereof to little purpoſe. <hi>Firſt</hi> therefore M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> by thoſe words [<hi>which is a humane law ſo eaſily and directly deduced from the very principles of</hi> Nature, <hi>that all</hi> Nations <hi>doe receiue and admit it</hi>] doth ſeeme to ſignifie, that onely the knowne morall <hi>principles</hi> or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall <hi>maximes</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> or naturall reaſon doe belong to the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and the <hi>concluſions,</hi> which are eaſily and directly deduced from them, doe belong to the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Nations:</hi> which doctrine neuertheleſſe all the <hi>Diuines</hi> of this age, euen of his owne <hi>Societie</hi> doe commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect;<note place="margin">

would argue thus: <hi>All temporall things are inferiour, ſubiect, and ſubordinate to ſpirituall things,</hi> to wit, <hi>in worth, dignitie, and excellencie, therefore the</hi> Pope <hi>hath power to diſpoſe of all temporall things, when the good of the</hi> Church <hi>ſhall ſo require?</hi> But my <hi>Aduerſaries</hi> vſuall cuſtome is to darken, and confound the <hi>Readers</hi> vnderſtanding with a miſt of cloudie, and ambiguous words, which being once diſſolued, and taken away, the plaine, and perſpicuous trueth will preſently appeare. For as concerning his <hi>antecedent</hi> propoſition, which is, <hi>that all temporall things are inferiour to ſpirituall things, and ſubordinate thereto, firſt,</hi> if his meaning be, that all temporall things are inferiour and ſubordinate to all ſpirituall things in euery kind of ſubiection, this is apparantly falſe, for that all ſpirituall things are not capeable of all kind of ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſeeing that onely ſpirituall <hi>perſons,</hi> or <hi>ſubſtances,</hi> and not ſpirituall <hi>accidents</hi> are capable of ſpirituall authoritie, or iuriſdiction, which conſiſteth in a power to commaund, to puniſh, or to diſpoſe of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p n="34">34 <hi>Secondly,</hi> if his meaning be, that all temporall things are infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, and ſubordinate to all ſpirituall things in ſome kind of ſubiection, this is very true; for as all ſpirituall things, in that they are ſpirituall, are more excellent, and of a more noble, more perfect, and of a ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and higher degree or order, then is any temporall thing, ſo all temporall things, as they are temporall, are inferiour, and ſubordinate in nobilitie, perfection and excellencie to all ſpirituall things: But from a ſuperioritie in perfection, worth, and nobilitie to conclude a ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of another kind, to wit, in authoritie, iuriſdiction, or power to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thereon, is <hi>tranſcendere de genere ad genus, to tranſcend from one kind to another,</hi> which manner of arguing euery Schoole-boy knoweth to bee vicious: as thus, <hi>Angels</hi> both good, and bad are ſuperiour to men in ſubſtance, knowledge, might, and other natural perfections, but to conclude from hence, that therefore <hi>Angels</hi> are ſuperiour to men in authoritie, or Iuriſdiction, and that therefore men are inferiour and ſubiect therein to <hi>Angels,</hi> and are bound to obey them as their lawfull Superiours, vnleſſe they bee ſent as meſſengers from <hi>God,</hi> which the <hi>Greeke</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">

by ſpirituall things doeth not vnderſtand all ſpirituall things, but only ſpirituall perſons, who by their office haue charge of Religion, and of all ſpirituall things appertaining to Religion, and that all tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things are by the inſtinct of <hi>nature,</hi> and the light of naturall reaſon ſubiect, and ſubordinate to ſpirituall perſons in ſuch ſort, that they may bee diſpoſed of by them, when the good of Religion ſhall ſo require, then indeede ſuppoſing this <hi>antecedant</hi> propoſition to bee true, it doeth neceſſarily follow, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath power to <hi>dispoſe</hi> of all temporall things in order to ſpirituall good; But then hee ſuppoſeth that which he ſhould prooue, and which I euer denyed: for, as I haue amply ſhewed before, by the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> the ciuill Common-wealth it ſelfe, and the ſupreame Gouernours thereof had ſupreame authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to <hi>diſpoſe</hi> of all things, as well concerning Religion, as State, and policie.

            <p n="36">36 Wherefore to little purpoſe are thoſe words, which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herbert</hi> next adioyneth. <hi>And therefore</hi> Vlpian <hi>the Lawyer,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>affirming that</hi> Ius Gentium, <hi>the</hi> Law <hi>of</hi> Nations, <hi>is that, which is common onely to men, putteth for example,</hi> Religio erga Deum, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion towards God, <hi>giuing to vnderstand, that all</hi> Nations, <hi>and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple doe agree in nothing more, then that due honour is to bee giuen to Almightie</hi> GOD, <hi>which is not done, when any thing is preferred before his ſeruice, or when temporall things are not ſubordinate to spirituall, and due reuerence, respect, and obedience giuen to his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Ministers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="37">37 But what is all this to the purpoſe? what will hee conclude from hence? who maketh any doubt, but that all <hi>Nations</hi> and people doe vniformely agree in this, that due honour is to be giuen to almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>God,</hi> and that nothing is to be preferred before his ſeruice, and that temporall things are ſubordinate to ſpirituall, to wit, in perfection, worth, and excellency, and that due reuerence, reſpect, and obedience is to be giuen to his immediate Miniſters?

            <p n="38">38 Wherefore with theſe generall propoſitions, which all men vnderſtand and approoue, he ſtill ioyneth that ambiguous and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocall propoſition, <hi>that temporall things are inferiour and ſubordinate to ſpirituall things,</hi> to make the vnlearned <hi>Reader</hi> beleiue that ſome great myſterie lyeth hidden therein, whereas the plaine meaning of it is, that ſpirituall things are ſuperiour to temporall things in worth, excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and dignity, and therefore <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> to bee preferred before them, ſo that in very deed the meaning thereof is nothing elſe, but that the ſeruice of God is to be preferred before all temporall things, which in the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> all ciuill Common-wealths which had ſupreame authority to diſpoſe of all things both concerning State and Religion, did euer acknowledge.

            </argument>
            <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E are come now at laſt, <hi>courteous Reader,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine what conuincing arguments can bee brought for proofe of this new pretended Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith, touching the <hi>Popes</hi> power to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Princes</hi> out of the <hi>Canon law,</hi> and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the <hi>decree</hi> of the great and famous <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell</hi> of <hi>Lateran,</hi> whereon my principall <hi>Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,</hi> ſeeing belike all their other arguments and authorities to bee cleane ſhaken and battered, doe now chiefly rely.

               <hi>that I am falne into flat hereſie, yea, which is more, by my owne grant, and confeſſion,</hi> and why forſooth? for not vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the <hi>Decree</hi> in that ſenſe, wherein Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and ſome later <hi>Diuines,</hi> ſpecially <hi>Ieſuites</hi> doe vnderſtand it, as though the authoritie of theſe men is ſo great, that wee are bound to accept their priuate expoſitions concerning any text of holy <hi>Scriptures,</hi> or ſacred <hi>Canons,</hi> for the <hi>voice</hi> of the <hi>Catholike Church.</hi> But how vaine are the bragges of this boaſting man, and how palpable are his ſlanders, taxing me of <hi>ridiculous abſurditie, folly, temeritie, malice, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie, impudencie, and hereſie,</hi> and then eſpecially, when my anſweres are moſt ſtrong, and his <hi>Replyes</hi> moſt childiſh, and impertinent, you haue partly ſeene in the former <hi>Chapters,</hi> and in the reſt alſo you ſhall more cleerely perceiue.</p>
            <p n="3">3 But before I come to ſhew what is the true ſenſe, and meaning of this <hi>decree,</hi> it will not bee amiſſe <hi>first</hi> to ſee, of what authoritie and credit among all <hi>Catholikes</hi> this great and famous <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Lateran</hi> is, and ought to bee, for this is very materiall to know, whether any <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree</hi> therein contained bee of it ſelfe ſufficient to make any matter of faith, which all Catholikes are bound to beleeue to be of faith: as alſo, becauſe <hi>ſome make doubt,</hi>

whereat were preſent 630.

And one chiefe ground of this difficultie is taken from the teſtomonie of our countrey-man <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> a <hi>Benedictiue</hi> Monke of the Monaſterie of <hi>S.

               <note place="margin">See his Hiſtorie of Henrie the <hi>3.</hi> in the yeere. 1248.</note> and was alſo reputed a man <hi>probatae vitae &amp; religionis expertae, of an approoued life, and tried religion,</hi> as Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the 4. doth teſtifie, in regard whereof he was by the ſame Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> ſent into the kingdome of <hi>Norway</hi> to reforme the <hi>Monaſterie</hi> of <hi>Holme;</hi> although in regard of his freedome of ſpeech, and vpright dealing he is vndeſeruedly taxed by the moſt <hi>Illuſtrious,</hi> and renowmed <hi>Cardinall</hi> de <hi>Peron,</hi> as a great enemie to <hi>Popes,</hi> in which reſpect he might alſo taxe him, as a great enemie to all, both <hi>Popes,</hi> and <hi>Kings, Clerkes,</hi> and <hi>Laikes,</hi> yea and to thoſe of his owne <hi>Order,</hi> for that hee freely, and without partialitie rehearſeth, and taxeth the vices of all: But the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>prouerbe</hi> is by dayly experience found true, <hi>Ohſequium amicos, veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas odium parit.

            </p>
            <p n="5">5 Thus therefore hee writeth of that <hi>Councell,</hi>

               </note> after hee hath ſet downe the time, and place where it was held, and the number of perſons who were preſent thereat: <hi>All theſe being gathered together in the place aforeſaid, and according to the manner of Generall Councells euery man being placed in his order, the</hi> Pope <hi>hauing made firſt an exhortation,</hi> 60. <hi>Chapters were rehearſed in the full</hi> Councell, <hi>which to ſome did ſeeme plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, or eaſie, to others burdenſome.

For when they now perceiued nothing to bee done in ſo great a buſineſſe, they being deſirous to returne home, deſired leaue one after another: which the</hi> Pope <hi>did not grant them, before they had promiſed him a great ſumme of money, which they were conſtrained firſt to borrow of</hi> Romane <hi>merchants, and pay it to the</hi> Pope <hi>before they were permitted

            </p>
            <p n="6">6 From which worde of <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> it ſeemeth to follow, that neither all theſe 60.

            <p n="11">11 The <hi>ſecond circumſtance</hi> is, that there was as much decreed in the <hi>Councell</hi> concerning the recouery of the holy Land, and as plainely, as touching any other thing, as it is manifeſt by the laſt Chapter; <hi>Being mooued,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Pope, with a vehement deſire to deliuer the Holy land from the hands of the wicked, by the aduice of prudent men, who fully know the circumſtances of times,</hi>

            <p n="12">12 The <hi>third circumſtance</hi> is, that this ſo great and famous <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,</hi> which was celebrated in the yeare 1215. was not publiſhed to the view of the world, and placed among the other <hi>Councels,</hi> but 300. yeares after it was celebrated, to wit, in the yeare 1538. and that by a <hi>German,</hi> who affirmeth, <hi>that he had theſe decrees out of an ancient Booke,</hi> but from whence, or from whom he had this Booke, or of what cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit it was, he maketh no mention: and <hi>Iacobus Merlin,</hi> who printed the <hi>Councels</hi> but three yeares before; did cleane omit this <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran.</hi> Now what prudent man, ſay they, can imagine, that if this <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,</hi> and all the decrees, which are now therein contained, had beene approoued by the generall conſent of the Fathers, who were preſent thereat, either <hi>Pope Innoncent</hi> himſelfe, who would haue cauſed the ſaid decrees forthwith to be publiſhed, as other approoued Councels haue euer beene publiſhed, or that his <hi>Nephew,</hi> and next Succeſſour but one, <hi>Pope Gregory</hi> the ninth, as he was carefull to publiſh all his Vncles <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretall Epiſtles,</hi> and theſe decrees alſo, which were propounded by him in this <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Lateran,</hi> whereof the greateſt part of the <hi>Canon law,</hi> called the <hi>decretals</hi> of the <hi>Pope Gregory</hi> the ninth, is compounded, ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo hee would not haue neglected to publiſh this ſo great and famous <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Lateran,</hi> and the Canons therein decreed, if it had beene certaine, that they were approoued and confirmed by the conſent of the whole <hi>Councell:</hi> or if there had beene any <hi>authenticall</hi> copie of this <hi>Councell</hi> preſerued in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> as by all likelihood there would haue beene, if the <hi>Councell</hi> had beene complete, and <hi>Oecumenicall,</hi> and the decrees therein propounded, had beene approoued by the generall conſent of the Fathers) ſome one or other <hi>Romane Antiquary</hi> would in 300. yeares ſpace haue cauſed it to be publiſhed, and that we ſhould not haue needed a <hi>Germans</hi> helpe to ſeeke out in <hi>Germanie</hi> after 300. yeares a copie of this <hi>Councell</hi> to publiſh as <hi>authenticall.</hi>

            <p n="15">15 All theſe things being conſidered, it is very probable, ſay they, that <hi>albeit many things were conſulted of in the Councell, yet nothing at all,</hi> eſpecially concerning thoſe decrees, <hi>which to ſome ſeemed eaſie, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers burdenſome, could be plainely decreed,</hi> that is, concluded and agreed vpon by any publike, and knowne authenticall decree of the whole <hi>Councell,</hi> or greateſt part thereof, hitherto publiſhed to the view of the world: yet it may very well be, that moſt of thoſe Fathers gaue at leaſt wiſe their priuate or tacite conſent to the publiſhing of many of thoſe 60.

               <hi>Decrees,</hi> becauſe they are now receiued by the generall conſent of all Catholikes, either by vertue of the <hi>Canon law,</hi> contained in the booke of <hi>Decretals,</hi> which <hi>Pope Gregory</hi> the <hi>ninth</hi> commanded to be obſerued, and practiſed by all men, or becauſe they are approoued by common conſent, but not by virtue of the authoritie of the <hi>Councell,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in nothing was decreed, and agreed vpon by any knowne, and authenticall approbation of the Fathers, although doubtleſſe they did by their priuate, or tacite conſent approoue many of thoſe 60. or 70. Decrees.</p>
            <p n="17">17 The <hi>ſecond</hi> argument is, for that both <hi>Councells, Popes,</hi> and <hi>Sholaſticall Doctours,</hi> doe cite ſome of the aforeſaid 60. or 70. Decrees, as of the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Lateran.</hi> But to this alſo they anſwere, that theſe Decrees are called <hi>Canons</hi> of the <hi>Councell Lateran,</hi> for that they were propounded and <hi>rehearſed</hi> in the <hi>Councell,</hi> but not confirmed or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued by the generall acceptance, and conſent of the Fathers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>they ſeemed to ſome to bee eaſie and pleaſing, but to others heauy and burdenſome.</hi> To theſe may be added a <hi>third</hi> argument, that the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Conſtance</hi> in the 39. Seſſion ordaining what profeſſion the future <hi>Pope</hi> was to make, decreeth, <hi>that euery future</hi> Pope <hi>hereafter to bee cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, muſt make this confeſſion, and profeſſion, before his election be publiſhed, that he doth firmely beleeue the holy Catholike faith, according to the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the</hi> Apoſtles, <hi>of generall</hi> Councells, <hi>and of other holy Fathers, but especially of the eight Sacred generall</hi> Councells, <hi>to wit, of the firſt</hi> Nicene, <hi>of the ſecond</hi> Conſtantinopolitan, <hi>of the third</hi> Epheſine, <hi>of the fourth</hi> Chalcedon, <hi>of the fifth and ſixth Constantinopolitan,</hi> of the <hi>ſeuenth</hi> Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene, <hi>and the eight Conſtantinopolitan, and alſo</hi> of Lateran, Lyons, <hi>and</hi> Vienna <hi>alſo generall Councells.</hi> But to this they alſo anſwere, that by the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Lateran</hi> is not vnderſtood this vnder <hi>Pope Innocent</hi> the third, but the former celebrated vnder <hi>Pope Alexander</hi> the third, in the yeere 1180. and if it bee vnderſtood of this <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Lateran,</hi> it is only, ſay they, foraſmuch as concerneth thoſe decrees wherein mention is made of the approbation of the <hi>Councell,</hi> as is that 46. decree which the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Conſtance</hi> mentioneth in the Bull of the confirmation of the Emperour <hi>Frederikes constitution.</hi> As alſo by the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Lyons</hi> it doth not vnderſtand that vnder <hi>Pope Innocent</hi> the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. who in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence thereof excommunicated the <hi>Emperour Fredricke,</hi> and whereat only 140.

            <p n="18">18 Theſe be the principall difficulties both againſt, and for the authoritie of this <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Lateran,</hi> which, before I came to examine the ſenſe &amp; meaning of the decree which is now in queſtion, I thought
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:150436:206"/>
needfull to ſet downe, that the <hi>Reeder</hi> may thereby iudge, whether if one for the reaſons aforeſaid ſhould deny the authority of this <hi>Councel,</hi> and affirme, that nothing was therein plainly concluded by any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and authenticall decree, approoued by the common conſent of the greateſt part of the Fathers there preſent, may be excuſed from all note of <hi>hereſie, errour,</hi> and <hi>temerity,</hi> in that manner as the <hi>Doctors</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> may be excuſed from thoſe aſperſions, for ſtill defending the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a <hi>Generall Councell,</hi> aboue a true and vndoubted <hi>Pope,</hi> and deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the authority of the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Lateran</hi> vnder <hi>Pope Leo</hi> the tenth, wherein the contrary doctrine, as Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith, is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defined; yet for my owne part, as I ſaid before, I doe willingly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, and admit the authority of this great <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Lateran,</hi> and of euery Canon and Decree therein contained, and namely of this which is now in queſtion, and doe onely contend about the true ſenſe and meaning thereof, as is vſuall in the holy Scriptures themſelues, which ſome expound one way, ſome another, not intending thereby to cal in queſtion the authority of <hi>Gods</hi> word but onely to examine and declare what is the true ſenſe and meaning thereof.</p>
            <p n="19">19 Now let vs ſee, what M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> ſaith in this <hi>Chapter</hi> againſt my anſwere, wherein I briefly declared the true ſenſe and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this <hi>Decree.</hi> Thus therefore he beginneth: <hi>It reſteth now,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that I examine the probability of</hi> Widdringtons <hi>anſweres to my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments grounded vpon the</hi> Canon law, <hi>and specially vpon a conſtitution and Canon of the great and famous</hi> Councell <hi>of</hi> Lateran.

            <p n="41">41 True it is, that nothing is more cleere, then that all <hi>Lawes</hi> are limited according to the power of the <hi>Prince</hi> that maketh them, and that therefore the obligation of euery <hi>Princes</hi> lawes is extended onely to his owne ſubiects.

            <p n="42">42 Wherefore I doe not reſtraine the ſenſe of the <hi>Canon</hi> to the

matter, wherein temporall <hi>Princes</hi> are ſupreame, and ſubiect to none but God.

<pb n="398" facs="tcp:150436:217"/>
that all men being repreſſed by the feare of God, and fearing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued puniſhments threatned againſt them, may keepe immooueable, and without perturbation the peace of the holy Churches of God.

            </p>
            <p n="17">17 Now what will M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> ſay to this ancient decree of Pope <hi>Liberius,</hi> which hee wiſheth mee well to note, wherein it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, that <hi>Biſhops,</hi> if they perturbe the peace of the <hi>Church,</hi> ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of their Prieſthood by <hi>Regall</hi> or Kingly indignation? For that ſecular men being placed in dignity, may be depriued of their honour and dignity, and if they be priuate men, yet noble, may forfeit all their goods, and if they be ignoble, may be whipped, or perpetually bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by <hi>Regall</hi> or <hi>Kingly</hi> power, or indignation, which this Canon alſo, of what credit ſoeuer it be, doth ordaine, is not any way repugnant to my doctrine.

            <p n="18">18 <hi>Thirdly,</hi> in what ſenſe I affirmed that <hi>Kings</hi> and abſolute <hi>Princes</hi> are not included in penall lawes vnder <hi>generall words,</hi> vnleſſe they be expreſſed by <hi>name;</hi> for which reſpect alſo M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> wiſheth me to note well this Canon of Pope <hi>Liberius,</hi> I haue declared before, to wit, that they are not in ſuch lawes comprehended vnder <hi>generall words,</hi> which denote ſome inferiour office or title of honour for I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer intended to denie, as this man impoſeth vpon me, that they are not included in any <hi>generall words,</hi> except they be ſpecified by the name of <hi>Princes,</hi> if ſuch <hi>generall words</hi> denote no inferiour office, or title of honour. So that neither <hi>Hoſtienſis,</hi> for as much as concerneth this Canon of <hi>Liberius,</hi> contradicteth my doctrine, becauſe thoſe <hi>generall words,</hi> Qui contra pacem Eccleſiae, <hi>They who are againſt the peace of the Church,</hi> do denote no inferiour office, or title of honour, and although he were againſt my doctrine, it is too little to the purpoſe, ſeeing that other <hi>Lawyers</hi> and <hi>Diuines</hi> doe contradict him herein, and moreouer this <hi>Canon</hi> cited by <hi>Hoſtienſis,</hi> is neither <hi>authenticall,</hi> and of ſufficient credit, nor any way gaine-ſaith that, which I affirme concerning this poynt.</p>

               <hi>theſe rules haue many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, which are very conſiderable, and haue place in this caſe.

            </p>
            <p n="30">30 And the <hi>Lawyers</hi> alſo doe abſolutely, and without the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaide exceptions affirme the aforeſaide rules to bee true.

            <p n="31">31 But the maine, and principall ground, whereon I ſtand, why abſolute <hi>Princes</hi> are not comprehended in this <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Lateran Councell,</hi> vnder thoſe generall wordes, <hi>Dominus temporalis, Dominus principalis,</hi> is this, as you haue ſeene before, for that, albeit I ſhould grant my <hi>Aduerſarie</hi> onely for diſputation ſake, that in <hi>penall lawes,</hi> and <hi>odious matters Abbots</hi> are included in the name of <hi>Monkes,</hi> and <hi>Biſhops</hi> in the name of <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> in the name of temporall <hi>Lords,</hi> which neuertheleſſe he will neuer bee able to conuince, yet ſeeing that it is moſt cleare, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> alſo confeſſeth, <hi>that all lawes are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited according to the power of the Law-maker, and that therefore the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation both of Princes, and Church lawes is extended onely to their owne ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,</hi> it neceſſarily followeth, that temporall <hi>Princes</hi> cannot bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended vnder any generall words, in any <hi>Canon,</hi> or conſtitution of the <hi>Church,</hi> but onely in thoſe things, wherein they are ſubiect to the ſpirituall power of the <hi>Church.</hi> From whence it cleerely followeth, that if it bee <hi>probable,</hi> as in very deede it is, that the ſpirituall Paſtours of the <hi>Church</hi> haue no authoritie by the inſtitution of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to inflict tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall puniſhments, or to depoſe temporall <hi>Princes,</hi> it is alſo <hi>probable,</hi> that this <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Lateran Councell,</hi> as alſo all other ſuch like decrees, wherein temporall puniſhments are in <hi>generall words</hi> inflicted vpon temporall <hi>Lords, Gouernours,</hi> or <hi>Land-lords,</hi> was not made by ſpirituall, but by temporall authoritie, and therefore cannot comprehend abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute

and worthier perſons, when leſſe worthie, and leſſe noble perſons are expreſſed.</hi> And therefore, ſeeing that I haue now ſhewed him both learned <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours,</hi> and alſo a <hi>Canon</hi> of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> himſelfe, to prooue that <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> are not in penall lawes comprehended vnder the generall name of <hi>Prieſts,</hi> or <hi>Clearkes,</hi> nor <hi>Abbots,</hi> vnder the generall name of <hi>Monkes,</hi> nor <hi>Kings</hi> vnder the generall name of <hi>Lords, Gouernours,</hi> or <hi>Landlords,</hi> he muſt according to his owne confeſſion grant, that I haue reaſon to exempt <hi>Emperours,</hi> Kings, and abſolute <hi>Princes,</hi> from the <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Lateran Councell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="34">34 Neither did I ground this my doctrine vpon the Canon, <hi>Quia periculoſum,</hi> wherein it is decreed, that in the caſe of <hi>Suſpenſion,</hi> &amp; <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, Biſhops</hi> are not comprehended vnder any generall words whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, vnleſſe they be expreſſed by the name of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> but vpon the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities aforeſaid, &amp; chiefly vpon that reaſon which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzher.</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe acknowledgeth to be moſt true, that <hi>all lawes are to be vnderſtood according to the power of the Law-maker, and that therefore the obligation of euery Eccleſiaſticall Canon is extended onely to thoſe, who are ſubiect to the ſpirituall authority of the Church,</hi> as abſolute <hi>Princes</hi> are not in <hi>meere</hi> tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall matters, as is the inflicting of temporall puniſhments, for what cauſe, crime, or end ſoeuer they be inflicted, according to the probable doctrine of many learned <hi>Catholikes,</hi> whom I haue named aboue in the <hi>firſt</hi> part of this <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> and defended them from the friuolous excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> hath made againſt them.</p>

               <hi>Thus thou ſeest,</hi> good Reader, <hi>that theſe few exceptions (being all that</hi> Widdrington <hi>hath taken) to the</hi> Councell <hi>of</hi> Lateran <hi>in his anſwere to my</hi> Supplement, <hi>are no leſſe vaine and impertinent, then his former argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and anſweres to the reſt of my diſcourſe: and this is as much as at the firſt I meant, and vndertooke to performe; neuertheleſſe, foraſmuch as he hath charged me to haue diſſembled his other anſweres and arguments touching the</hi> Councell <hi>of</hi> Lateran <hi>in another worke of his (which as I haue ſignified before I neuer ſaw till now of late) I will take a little more paines, and craue thy further patience, whiles I examine the validitie thereof, which I might forbeare to doe if I did write in</hi> Latin, <hi>becauſe the ſame arguments and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweres of my</hi> Aduerſary, <hi>are very learnedly and cleerely confuted in</hi> Latin, <hi>as well by</hi> M.

               <hi>were it not that I deſire to giue ſatisfaction in this point, as well to ſuch as doe not vnderſtand the</hi> Latin <hi>tongue, as to thoſe that haue not the commodity and meanes to ſee the ſaid Treatiſes; beſides that, I ſhall now and then, vpon ſome speciall occaſions, touch ſome things which ſeeme to me very conſiderable, and are not touched by them, or any other, for ought I know.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="39">39 But on the contrary ſide thou ſeeſt, <hi>good Reader,</hi> that theſe anſweres, which I haue giuen to the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Lateran,</hi> are ſound, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and very probable, and that the exceptions which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> hath taken againſt them, are no leſſe <hi>vaine</hi> and <hi>impertinent,</hi> then are his arguments and anſweres in the former <hi>Chapters;</hi> and that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his owne confeſſion, who granteth, <hi>that all lawes are limitted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the power of the Law-maker,</hi> and therefore the obligation of <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Canons</hi> is extended onely to them, who are ſubiect to the authoritie of the <hi>Church,</hi> if it be <hi>probable</hi> that the ſpirituall <hi>Paſtours</hi> of

the <hi>Church</hi> haue by the inſtitution of <hi>Chriſt</hi> no authoritie to <hi>inflict</hi> tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall puniſhments, and that conſequently <hi>abſolute Princes</hi> are not ſubiect to them therein, it cleerely followeth that it is alſo <hi>probable,</hi> that the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Lateran</hi> did not intend to include <hi>abſolute Princes</hi> in that penall law vnder the generall names of <hi>Dominus temporalis, Dominus principalis,</hi> but that this <hi>decree</hi> inflicting temporall puniſhments, was made by the authority and conſent of temporall <hi>Princes,</hi> and did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore onely include thoſe inferiour <hi>Land-lords, Gouernours</hi> or <hi>Lords,</hi> that were ſubiect to them.</p>
            <p n="40">40 Wherefore to conclude this point, vnleſſe, as I ſaid before, my <hi>Aduerſaries</hi> doe <hi>firſt</hi> prooue out of the <hi>holy Scriptures, ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> or <hi>ſome cleere definition</hi> of a <hi>generall Councell,</hi> or a <hi>demonſtratiue reaſon</hi> grounded thereon, that it is <hi>certaine,</hi> and of <hi>faith,</hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath authority to depoſe temporall <hi>Princes,</hi> they cannot draw any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincing argument from this <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Lateran Councell,</hi> to prooue that doctrine to be <hi>certaine,</hi> and of <hi>faith,</hi> for ſtill the aforeſaid anſwere will bee ready at hand, that it was made by the authority of <hi>temporall Princes, ſeeing all lawes are limitted according to the power of the Law-maker,</hi> and it is <hi>probable,</hi> that the <hi>spirituall</hi> power of the <hi>Church</hi> doth not extend to the <hi>inflicting</hi> of temporall puniſhments, as <hi>Almaine,</hi> and <hi>very many Doctours</hi> doe affirme.

            <p>
               <hi>My Aduerſary</hi> Widdrinton <hi>in his</hi> Preface <hi>to his</hi> Apologeticall <hi>anſwere to an</hi> Engliſh Doctour, <hi>hath not onely vrged the arguments,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Praefat. Ad. Reſp.

            </p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Thus argueth he for vs, and not much amiſſe, and therefore let vs ſee how he will anſwere it. He giueth to this obiection three anſweres; The</hi> firſt <hi>is, that both</hi> Popes, <hi>and</hi> Councells <hi>doe oftentimes decree many things, which belong rather to the politicall or temporall, then to the ſpirituall, or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiasticall power to decree, with the expreſſe, or tacite conſent of</hi> Princes, <hi>who are there preſent by themſelues, or their Ambaſſadours, or at leaſtwiſe preſuming, or hoping, that</hi> Princes <hi>will ratifie the ſame.

<pb n="410" facs="tcp:150436:223"/>
the goods of heretikes to be confiſcated, demaundeth what the</hi> Pope <hi>hath to doe with temporalls?

            </p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>This is</hi> Widdringtons <hi>firſt anſwere, wherein you ſee he relyeth ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially vpon the authoritie of</hi> Ioannes Pariſienſis, <hi>who grounding his opinion vpon</hi> Hoſtienſis, <hi>alledgeth him to no purpoſe at all, partly for that no ſuch thing is to be found in</hi> Hoſtienſis <hi>in the place, which he quoteth (to wit,</hi> extra de haereticis cap.<note place="margin">

Si quis deinceps; <hi>but alſo the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of</hi> Zacharias <hi>the</hi> Pope, <hi>who,</hi> ſaith he, depoſuit Childericum Regem Franciae, depoſed Childericke King of France. <hi>How then can</hi> Ioannes Pariſienſis, <hi>or any man elſe truely ſay, that</hi> Hoſtienſis <hi>was of opinion, that the</hi> Pope <hi>hath nothing to doe with temporall things?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 But <hi>firſt,</hi> where doth M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> finde <hi>Ioannes Pariſienſis</hi> to ſay, that <hi>Hoſtienſis</hi> was of opinion, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath nothing to doe with temporall things? For that which <hi>Pariſienſis</hi> ſaith, is onely this, <hi>that</hi> Hoſtienſis <hi>giueth this anſwere, that the</hi> Pope <hi>hath nothing to doe with temporall things,</hi> and that it belongeth not to him to make generall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees concerning the confiſcation of goods, and that this <hi>Decree</hi> was made with the aſſent of the Emperour, who was then preſent at <hi>Padua,</hi> and gaue his conſent thereto, but whether <hi>Hoſtienſis</hi> gaue this anſwere according to his owne opinion; or of other <hi>Lawyers,</hi> whom he doth not condemne, <hi>Ioannes Pariſienſis</hi> neither affirmeth, nor denieth, but onely ſaith, that <hi>Hoſtienſis</hi> gaue this anſwere, which is very true. But theſe be vſuall trickes of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert,</hi> as you haue often ſeene aboue, to miſconſtrue the words, and meaning of his <hi>Aduerſarie,</hi> thereby to make ſome colourable ſhew of a probable anſwere. Wherfore although it be moſt true, that <hi>Hoſtienſis</hi> is of opinion, that the <hi>Pope</hi> may vpon iuſt cauſe diſpoſe of the Dominions of all <hi>Chriſtian Princes,</hi> and of all temporall things, for that he expreſly teacheth, that the <hi>Pope</hi> is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſpirituall, but alſo a temporall <hi>Monarch</hi> of the whole world, and hath <hi>direct dominion</hi> ouer all temporall States, yet I doe not find <hi>Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſis</hi> to be ſo peremptorie in his opinion, as to condemne the <hi>contrarie

doctrine</hi> of <hi>hereſie</hi> or of <hi>abſurd,</hi> and <hi>temerarious improbabilitie,</hi> as all my <hi>Aduerſaries</hi> not without great <hi>temeritie</hi> now vſallly doe.</p>
            <p n="5">5 <hi>Secondly,</hi> therefore it is alſo true, that <hi>Hoſtienſis</hi> vpon the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Chapter, Ad abolendam,</hi> giueth alſo that anſwere, whereof <hi>Ioannes Pariſienſis</hi> maketh mention, and doth not reiect it as <hi>improbable,</hi> in which ſenſe <hi>Pariſienſis</hi> did call it <hi>Hoſtienſis</hi> his anſwere. And this anſwere M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> might haue eaſily found in the foreſaid place, if he had not relyed vpon Fa. <hi>Leſſius</hi> word, who ſaith as much, but had read o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the whole <hi>Chapter</hi> himſelfe. For whereas Pope <hi>Lucius</hi> the third did in that Canon, <hi>Ad abolendam,</hi> ordaine (from whom it is probable Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third tooke that decree of the <hi>Lateran Councell,</hi> ſeeing that in ſubſtance they little differ) <hi>vt Comites, Barones, Rectores, &amp;c. that Earles, Barons, Gouernours, and Conſulls of Cities, and of other places</hi> (whom the Councell of Lateran comprehendeth vnder the names of <hi>Dominus temporalis, Dominus principalis, &amp; non habens Dominos principale) ſhall promiſe by making a corporall oath, according as they ſhall be admoniſhed by the Biſhops, that they will faithfully, and effectually, when they ſhall be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by them, helpe the</hi> Church <hi>againſt heretikes, and their partakers, vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly according to their office and power: and if they ſhall not obſerue the ſame, let them be depriued of the honour, which they haue, and let them in no wiſe be aſſumed to other honours, &amp;c.</hi> The Cardinall <hi>Hoſtienſis</hi> vpon theſe wordes, <hi>vt Comites &amp;c.</hi> to prooue the <hi>validitie</hi> of this <hi>Canon,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other anſweres he giueth alſo this, which he doth not confute, that <hi>ſome Doctors doe ſay, that therefore this</hi> Canon <hi>was of force, becauſe the Emperour was preſent, and gaue his conſent ſecundum D. N. according to Pope Innocent the fourth, whom he called</hi> Dominum noſtrum.</p>
            <p n="6">6 The ſame anſwere alſo hath <hi>Ioannes Andreas,</hi> expounding that word, <hi>Comites; Note,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>that the</hi> Pope <hi>doth decree concerning lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but this is in regard of ſinne. Others ſay, that therefore theſe decrees were of force becauſe the</hi> Prince <hi>gaue his conſent, and was preſent.</hi> And alſo the ſame anſwere maketh Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the fourth expounding the ſame word, <hi>Comites; Note,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that the</hi> Pope <hi>may ordaine concerning Lay-men, but this is in regard of ſinne. Others ſay, that theſe decrees are therefore of force, becauſe the</hi> Prince <hi>was preſent.</hi> Wherefore it is very true, which <hi>Ioannes Pariſienſis</hi> ſaid, that Hoſtienſis with his <hi>Lord Pope Innocent,</hi> among other anſweres concerning the <hi>validitie</hi> of this <hi>Canon</hi> gaue alſo this, which they did not confute, <hi>that it was therefore valued, and of force, becauſe the</hi> Prince <hi>was preſent, and gaue his conſent.</hi> And therefore I maruaile, how Fa. <hi>Leſſius,</hi> a man otherwiſe very learned, and as I euer ſuppoſed, of great reading, ſhould be ſo ignorant in the ſtudie of the <hi>Canon law,</hi> as not to know, and much more ſo boldly to denie, that <hi>Hoſtienſis did write vpon the Chapter Ad abolendam, or vpon other textes;</hi> whereas there is no booke more knowne, and more commonly
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:150436:224"/>
cited by the <hi>Canon Lawyers,</hi> then is the <hi>Lecture</hi> of <hi>Hostienſis</hi> vpon the <hi>Decretalls.</hi> And thus much concerning <hi>Hostienſis,</hi> and his anſwere al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by <hi>Pariſienſis</hi> to great purpoſe, whatſoeuer my <hi>Aduerſarie,</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ouermuch credit to Fa. <hi>Leſſius,</hi> hath vntruly ſaide to the contrary.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Now concerning <hi>Ioannes Pariſienſis</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> writeth thus:<note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 158. <hi>nu.</hi> 4.</note> 
               <hi>But it is no maruaile if</hi> Ioannes Pariſienſis <hi>ſhewed himſelfe partiall towards</hi> Princes <hi>in ſome things concerning the</hi> Popes <hi>authority, ſeeing that he liued and was a Reader in</hi> Paris <hi>in the time of the troubles betwixt</hi> Pope Boniface <hi>the eight, and</hi> Philip le Bel, <hi>King of France, who being excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by the ſaid</hi> Pope, <hi>and extreamely incenſed againſt him could not want learned men to ſecond his humor; eſpecially ſuch as were his borne ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, and liued within his dominions; Neuertheleſſe howſoeuer</hi> Ioannes Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſienſis <hi>may ſeeme in the words alleadged by my</hi> Aduerſary <hi>to affirme, that the</hi> Pope <hi>hath no power at all to diſpoſe of temporall things; yet it is cleere that he teacheth elſewhere, that in ſome caſes the</hi> Pope <hi>may diſpoſe of the temporall goods, not onely of Eccleſiaſticall perſons, but alſo of all the faithfull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8 <hi>And of this</hi> Widdrington <hi>might haue taken notice, when he wrote againſt me, if it had pleaſed him, ſeeing that he was admoniſhed thereof by</hi> Schulckenius<note n="b" place="margin">Shulck. <hi>pag.</hi> 64.</note>, <hi>who ſheweth that</hi> Ioannes Pariſienſis <hi>teacheth expreſly,</hi>

               </note> 
               <hi>that the</hi> Pope <hi>being the ſupreme head of</hi> Prieſts, <hi>and of the faithfull, may (as the generall informer of faith and manners) diſpoſe the goods of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and decree them to bee expoſed, ſo farre foorth as the common and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame neceſſitie of faith and manners ſhall require; and</hi>

               </note> 
               <hi>further, that if the</hi> King <hi>be an hereticke, and incorrigible, the</hi> Pope <hi>may not onely excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate him, but alſo force the people to depoſe him,</hi> Excommunicando om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, qui ei vt Domino obedirent, Excommunicating all thoſe, which ſhould obey him as their Lord: <hi>and againe afterwards he ſaith</hi>

               </note>, <hi>that if the</hi> Prince <hi>be an hereticke, his vaſſall is not bound to follow him, and that the</hi> Pope <hi>may deliuer his ſubiects from the obligation of their oath of allegiance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9 <hi>By all this it appeareth, that albeit</hi> Ioannes Pariſienſis <hi>doth giue leſſe vnto the</hi> Pope <hi>then he ought (as</hi> Schulckenius <hi>well noteth) yet he giueth him as much as ſufficeth for our purpoſe, ſeeing that it little importeth to the ſubstance of the maine queſtion betwixt our Aduerſary and vs (which is, whether the</hi> Pope <hi>may depoſe a temporall Prince) I ſay it little importeth how, and in what manner he may doe it (whether by a Iuridicall ſentence of depoſition or otherwiſe) ſo as it is granted, that he hath authoritie to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the</hi> Princes <hi>ſubiects of their Oath of allegiance, yea and to compell them to depoſe him, which</hi> Ioannes Pariſienſis <hi>expreſly teacheth; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon it may be inferred, that his meaning was in the place before obiected, that the</hi> Pope <hi>may not diſpoſe of temporall things</hi> directly, <hi>but onely</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly, <hi>and in ſome caſes, which ouerthrowe the foundation of our</hi> Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:150436:224"/>
               <hi>doctrine touching this queſtion: and this may ſuffice for him and</hi> Hoſtienſis.</p>
            <p n="10">10 But <hi>firſt,</hi> beſides that <hi>Ioannes Pariſienſis</hi> was neuer taxed by any ancient <hi>Authour</hi> for writing partially in fauour of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> the like words that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> heere vſeth againſt <hi>Ioannes Pariſien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> may be retorted backe vpon <hi>Hoſtienſis,</hi> and diuers other <hi>Diuines,</hi> and <hi>Canoniſts,</hi> to wit, <hi>that it is no maruaile, that Cardinall</hi> Hoſtienſis, <hi>and diuers other Romane Diuines, and</hi> Canoniſts <hi>ſhewed themſelues partiall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Popes in ſome things concerning the Popes authoritie, ſeeing that they liued and were Readers in</hi> Rome, <hi>or in the</hi> Popes <hi>Dominions in the time of the troubles betwixt the</hi> Popes <hi>and</hi> Chriſtian Princes, which <hi>Popes</hi> ſince the time of <hi>Pope Gregorie</hi> the ſeuenth tooke vpon them to <hi>dispoſe</hi> of all temporalls, and to depoſe <hi>temporall Princes, and therefore could not want learned men to ſecond their humours, eſpecially ſuch as either were their borne ſubiects, and liued in their Dominions,</hi> or elſe might expect ſpirituall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, and to be aduanced to Biſhoprikes, or other ſpirituall digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by the <hi>Pope,</hi> and this alſo the ſaid <hi>Ioannes Pariſienſis</hi> in the ſame booke doth well obſerue. <hi>But more probably,</hi> ſaith he,<note n="h" place="margin">Ioan.

               </note> 
               <hi>it may be ſaid on the contrary ſide, that thoſe</hi> Doctours, <hi>who ſo vndutifully aduance the</hi> Popes <hi>authoritie, doe ſpeake for feare, or fauour of him, ſeeing that they are</hi> Clergie men, <hi>who may rather bee promoted by him: and eſpecially ſeeing that they themſelues doe ſay, though not well, that the</hi> Pope <hi>doth graciouſly embrace thoſe that doe extend, or amplifie his authoritie, and repreſſeth thoſe that ſpeake againſt the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11 <hi>Secondly, Ioannes Pariſienſis</hi> doth not teach that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath power to <hi>dispoſe</hi> of temporall things, and of the temporall goods, not onely of Eccleſiaſticall perſons, but alſo of all the faithfull, except one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by <hi>declaring</hi> the law of God, and by <hi>compelling</hi> the faithfull by Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall cenſures to obſerue the ſame, <hi>&amp; haec Papae ordinatio non eſt niſi iuris declaratio, &amp; this ordaining, or diſpoſing of the Pope, is nothing elſe, then a declaring of the Law of God,</hi> ſaith <hi>Pariſienſis</hi> in that very place;<note n="i" place="margin">
                  <hi>Cap.</hi> 7:</note> and this I haue declared and prooued at large aboue in the <hi>firſt part</hi> againſt D. <hi>Schulckenus.</hi> And the ſame hee teacheth concerning the <hi>abſoluing</hi> of <hi>vaſſalls</hi> from their oath of fealtie. <hi>To that,</hi> ſaith hee,<note n="k" place="margin">
                  <hi>Cap.</hi> 16. <hi>ad</hi> 11.</note> 
               <hi>which is obiected that the</hi> Pope <hi>hath ſometimes abſolued ſouldiers from their oath of fealtie. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that it is an argument</hi> De facto, <hi>which is onely introduced concerning</hi> French-men, <hi>I anſwere, that it was rather a</hi> declaring <hi>of the law, to wit, that the</hi> Oath <hi>did not bind in that caſe, then an abſoluing from the oath of fealtie:</hi> Now what Catholike man maketh doubt, but that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to <hi>declare</hi> the Law of <hi>God,</hi> it being a ſpirituall thing, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from ſpirituall power?</p>
            <p n="12">12 Wherefore, as I declared at large aboue in the <hi>firſt part, Ioannes Pariſienſis</hi> teacheth three things; The <hi>one</hi> is, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:150436:225"/>
to depoſe, or depriue by <hi>way of ſentence</hi> an hereticall <hi>Prince</hi> of his Royall right, and authority, and this is the maine queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt my <hi>Aduerſaries,</hi> and mee: The <hi>ſecond</hi> is, that the Pope hath power to declare and interprete the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and to compell by Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Cenſures all the faithfull to obſerue the ſame, and in this I agree with <hi>Pariſienſis,</hi> ſauing that there is yet a great controuerſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Diuines</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> what things are required to make the Popes <hi>definition, declaration,</hi> or <hi>interpretation</hi> to be certaine and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, as alſo inferiour <hi>Biſhops</hi> haue authority to declare and interpret the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and to compell their ſpirituall ſubiects to obſerue the ſame, yet their <hi>declaration</hi> and <hi>interpretation</hi> of the law of God, is not alwaies certaine and infallible. The <hi>third</hi> is, that the people or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth haue authority in ſome caſes, &amp; are bound to depoſe their <hi>Prince,</hi> and conſequently, that the Pope may by Eccleſiaſtical cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures compell them thereunto: And with this queſtion concerning the power of the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> as I haue often ſaid, I will not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle, before it be agreed vpon betwixt my <hi>Aduerſaries</hi> and mee, concerning the maine and principall controuerſie, <hi>whether the</hi> Pope <hi>hath authority to depriue by way of ſentence an hereticall</hi> King <hi>of his right to raigne,</hi> or, which is all one, to make by his <hi>iuridicall ſentence</hi> a King to be a priuate man; for this is that, at which our King and <hi>Parliament,</hi> in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the new <hi>oath</hi> of <hi>allegiance,</hi> did onely aime.</p>
            <p n="13">13 And by this it is apparant, how fraudulently, and perniciou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> following therein D. <hi>Schulckenius,</hi> ſeeketh to abuſe, and delude his <hi>Reader,</hi> in labouring to perſwade him, that it little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth to the ſubſtance of the maine queſtion betwixt my <hi>Aduerſaries</hi> and me, whether the Pope may depoſe a <hi>Prince</hi> by a <hi>iudiricall ſentence</hi> of depoſition, and depriue him of all his Regall authority and right, which before that ſentence he had to raigne, or whether the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> hath authority, and alſo is bound in ſome caſes to <hi>depoſe</hi> their King, and conſequently, whether the Pope, hauing authority to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the dutie which all Chriſtians owe to God, may by Eccleſiaſticall cenſures compell them thereunto, and abſolue them from their <hi>oath</hi> of <hi>allegiance,</hi> by declaring that their <hi>oath</hi> in that caſe doth not binde, which abſoluing, as <hi>Pariſienſis</hi> ſaid aboue, <hi>is rather a declaring of the law, then an abſoluing from the oath of allegiance:</hi> And neuertheleſſe there is nothing more cleere, then that the maine queſtion betwixt my <hi>Aduerſaries</hi> and mee, is not what authoritie the <hi>common-wealth</hi> hath ouer their <hi>Prince,</hi> which is rather a philoſophicall queſtion, and grounded vpon the <hi>principles</hi> of ſtate and policy, then vpon the <hi>poſitiue</hi> law of <hi>God,</hi> but what authority the <hi>Pope</hi> hath to depriue <hi>by way of ſentence</hi> hereticall <hi>Princes</hi> of their Princely right, and authority: or which is all one in ſubſtance, whether the <hi>coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciue,</hi>
               <pb n="415" facs="tcp:150436:225"/>
or <hi>puniſhing</hi> power of the <hi>Pope</hi> (for about his <hi>derectiue, declaratiue,</hi> and <hi>commanding power,</hi> to which his <hi>authority</hi> to <hi>declare</hi> the law of <hi>God,</hi> and what we are bound by the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>God</hi> to doe, is reduced, I doe not contend) doth by the <hi>institution</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> extend to the <hi>inflicting</hi> of temporall puniſhments, as all my <hi>Aduerſaries</hi> moſt vehemently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, or onely of <hi>Eccleſiasticall Cenſures,</hi> as <hi>Ioannes Pariſienſis</hi> doth moſt expreſly affirme.

<pb n="422" facs="tcp:150436:239"/>
his open profeſſion of hereſie, or forcing of his ſubiects to doe the ſame, whether, I ſay, all theſe, or ſome of them together may be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, or elſe any one of them bee ſufficient that an hereticall <hi>Prince</hi> bee <hi>ipſo facto</hi> depriued of his princely power and authority.</p>
            <p n="26">26 The <hi>third</hi> queſtion may be, ſuppoſing ſtill this falſe doctrine to be true, whether the <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Church</hi> haue authority to declare ſuch a <hi>Prince</hi> to be an hereticke, a breaker of his oath, and promiſe, and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor or enemy to Chriſt, and Chriſtian Religion, and conſequently to be fallen from all his Princely right: And of this no doubt can be made, ſuppoſing the former, ſeeing that to declare authentically what is <hi>hereſie,</hi> &amp; who is infected therw<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, is a ſpiritual action, &amp; conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belonging to the authority of the Pope, or Church. The <hi>fourth</hi> que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion may be, what effect this declaration of the Pope or Church doth worke, ſeeing that before this declaration the aforeſaid hereticall <hi>Prince</hi> hath loſt, and is depriued of all his princely authority, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this <hi>declaration</hi> of the <hi>Pope,</hi> or <hi>Church,</hi> be neceſſary, when the fact is ſo notorious, and publike, that no Subiect in the Realme can make any doubt but that the <hi>Prince</hi> is become an hereticke, hath broken his oath to liue and die in the Catholike faith, and doth force his Subiects conſciences to follow his hereſie: And of this queſtion alſo no great doubt in my opinion can be made, ſuppoſing the former falſe doctrine to be true, ſeeing that this <hi>declaration</hi> doth not depriue the <hi>Prince</hi> of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny right at all, but onely ſerueth to make it knowne, and publike, that he is depriued thereof, and therefore is not greatly neceſſary, when the <hi>fact</hi> is ſo publike and manifeſt to the view of the whole Kingdome, that no man can make any doubt thereof.</p>
            <p n="24">24 The <hi>fift</hi> queſtion may be, that ſuppoſing ſuch a Prince doth not fall <hi>ipſo facto</hi> from his Royall dignity, neither by his open profeſſion of hereſie, nor by breach of his oath, nor by forcing his Subiects con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences to forſake their Religion, whether the whole Kingdome, or Common-wealth, which the <hi>Parliament</hi> doth repreſent, hath autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to depriue him of the ſame; or, which is all one, whether the whole Kingdome or the King be the ſupreame and abſolute temporall Iudge, and Superiour: And this queſtion doth nothing appertaine to the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and it is grounded rather vpon the <hi>principles</hi> of <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Philoſophie,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotles Politikes,</hi> then of <hi>Diuinitie.</hi> The <hi>laſt</hi> and <hi>principall</hi> queſtion is, whether the <hi>Pope,</hi> or <hi>Church,</hi> hath authority to depriue ſuch a <hi>Prince</hi> for the aforeſaid crimes of his right to raigne, &amp; really, &amp; truly to abſolue his ſubiects from the natural bond of their temporall allegiance, which being once diſſolued, the ſacred or ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bond of the oath of allegiance, which is grounded vpon the former ciuill bond, and obligation, and was made onely to corroborate the ſame, is forthwith vnlooſed, or whether the <hi>Pope,</hi> or <hi>Church,</hi> hath only
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:150436:239"/>
authority to declare ſuch a <hi>Prince</hi> to be an hereticke, and an enemy to Catholicke Religion, and a breaker of his oath and promiſe, and to command &amp; compell by Eccleſiaſticall cenſures the Common-wealth, ſuppoſing they haue ſuch an authority to depriue him of his Regall power and authority, and conſequently to diſcharge euery ſubiect from the naturall and ciuill bond of his temporall allegiance, which being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, the ſacred obligation of the oath, without any other abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, diſpenſation, or declaration of the <hi>Pope,</hi> or <hi>Church,</hi> is forthwith diſſolued.</p>
            <p n="28">28 All theſe queſtions the <hi>Lord Cardinall</hi> of <hi>Peron</hi> doth ſo cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inuolue in his queſtion touching the oath of <hi>France,</hi> that, if wee deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to particulars, I cannot ſee either what opinion hee doth follow concerning the depoſing of hereticall <hi>Princes,</hi> or how his doctrine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugneth our <hi>Engliſh oath,</hi> (although he would ſeeme to diſprooue the ſame) which onely denyeth the Popes authority to depriue the <hi>Kings Maiestie</hi> of his Royall dignity, and to abſolue his ſubiects from the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill bond of their temporall allegiance, and doth not meddle at all with the temporall authority, which a Kingdome or Common-wealth hath to depoſe their <hi>Prince.</hi>

            <p n="41">41 But if M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> had beene pleaſed to conſider with an indifferent eye my anſwere, and the principall drift and ſcope thereof, he might eaſily haue ſeene that my anſwere was good and ſtrong, and the authority which I brought from <hi>Ioannes Pariſienſis,</hi> and <hi>Hoſtienſis,</hi> ſufficient to confirme the ſame. For my principall anſwere was this, that the decree of the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Lateran</hi> did not in thoſe generall words, <hi>Dominus temporalis, Dominus principalis, &amp; non habens Dominos principales,</hi> comprehend <hi>abſolute Princes,</hi> but onely inferiour <hi>Landlords, Magiſtrates,</hi> or <hi>Lords,</hi> it being made by the conſent and authority of <hi>abſolute Princes,</hi> as ordaining the inflicting of temporall puniſhments, which to ordaine doth not belong to the ſpirituall, but onely to the
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:150436:234"/>
temporall power, and that therefore not onely it did not, but alſo it could not in thoſe <hi>generall words</hi> comprehend abſolute <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> themſelues, by whoſe authority it was made.

            <p n="42">42 And by this it is cleare, that my meaning was not onely to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that the <hi>decree</hi> of the <hi>Lateran Councell,</hi> for as much as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the <hi>inflicting</hi> of temporall puniſhments, was made by the conſent of <hi>abſolute Princes,</hi> onely in that manner as <hi>abſolute Princes</hi> do giue their conſent to the making of Eccleſiaſticall lawes, and Canons, which doe meerely proceede from Eccleſiaſticall or ſpirituall authority, but alſo that it was made by the conſent and authority of <hi>abſolute Princes,</hi> for that to ordaine the inflicting of temporall puniſhments belongeth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the <hi>Ciuill,</hi> then to the <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> power, and therfore it would not haue had force to binde, vnleſſe <hi>abſolute Princes</hi> had conſented thereunto: As likewiſe the <hi>Canon, Ad abolendam,</hi> wherein temporall puniſhments were <hi>inflicted,</hi> was therefore of <hi>force,</hi> according to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of ſome <hi>Canoniſts,</hi> as <hi>Hoſtienſis</hi> relateth, for that the <hi>Emperour</hi> conſented thereunto, although the ordaining or <hi>inflicting</hi> of <hi>Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,</hi> which in that Canon <hi>Ad abolendam,</hi> was ioyned together with the <hi>depriuation</hi> of temporall <hi>honour,</hi> as it is alſo ioyned in the <hi>decree</hi> of the <hi>Lateran Councell,</hi> did proceed, and had <hi>force to binde,</hi> from the <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall</hi> authoritie of the <hi>Church,</hi> to whom onely it belongeth to <hi>inflict</hi> Eccleſiaſticall Cenſures.</p>

            </p>
            <p>But this proofe is as inſufficient as the former: <hi>First,</hi> for that this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> of <hi>Vrbanus</hi> is not authentical, but counterfait and falſly impoſed vpon Pope <hi>Vrbanus,</hi> as may euidently appeare by the <hi>ſubſcriptions</hi> of the <hi>Conſulls,</hi> to wit, of <hi>Antoninus,</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> whereas it is euident, as <hi>Baronius,</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="51">51 <hi>Secondly,</hi> for that it is alſo euident, that the whole <hi>Canon, Attendendum,</hi> wherein the penaltie of <hi>infamy, impriſonment,</hi> and of <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall baniſhment</hi> is ordained, as it is ſet downe, 17. q. 4. by <hi>Gratian,</hi> hath beene thruſt in by ſome one, or other to this <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> for that it hath no coherence at all with the words of the <hi>Epistle,</hi> which imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately follow, wherein the reaſon of this decree is giuen, whereas if the whole <hi>Canon Attendendum</hi> be left out, the ſenſe is perfect, and the reaſon there alledged very apt and ſufficient.

            <p n="52">52 <hi>Thirdly,</hi> what man can be ſo ſimple as to imagine, that either <hi>Pope Vrbanus,</hi> or any other <hi>Pope</hi> of the primitiue Church in the time of the <hi>Pagan Emperours,</hi> when not onely the goods of the Church were prophaned, taken away, and ſpoyled, but alſo the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues impriſoned, baniſhed, and put to cruell death, would make a <hi>Decree,</hi> that <hi>whoſoeuer did take away, or prophane the goods of</hi> Churches

               <hi>ſhould be committed to priſon, or perpetually baniſhed;</hi> euen as if M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Arch-Prieſt</hi> ſhould now make a decree, that whatſoeuer <hi>Catholike</hi> ſhall take the oath of allegiance, or repaire to <hi>Proteſtant Churches</hi> ſhall be <hi>impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned,</hi> or <hi>perpetually baniſhed:</hi> and yet theſe in my <hi>Aduerſaries</hi> iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are, forſooth, <hi>conuincing proofes.</hi> Neuertheleſſe this puniſhment of infamy is to be vnderſtood, as I ſhewed before, of ſpirituall infamy, to wit, foraſmuch as concerneth the ſpirituall Court: and the penaltie of perpetuall baniſhment, is to bee vnderſtood of ſpirituall baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or of baniſhment from the Church, as it is expreſly affirmed in the decree of his Predeceſſour <hi>Pope Callixtus.</hi> And therefore M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herbert</hi> may vſe ſome fraud, in vrging from the decree of <hi>Pope Vrbanus</hi> the penaltie of <hi>baniſhment,</hi> and in concealing the ſaid penaltie, in the decree of his Predeceſſour <hi>Pope Callixtus,</hi> who in expreſſe words made mention of <hi>baniſhment</hi> from the Church.</p>

            <p n="57">57 But <hi>laſtly,</hi> from theſe <hi>two Canons</hi> heere cited by my <hi>Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,</hi> this onely, at the moſt, can be forcibly deduced, that ſpirituall <hi>Paſtours</hi> haue authority to impoſe, command, and enioyne temporall and corporall penances, puniſhments, and afflictions, as to abſtaine for certaine daies from carnall copulation, and likewiſe to faſt, to weare haire-cloth, to giue almes, and ſuch like, which was ordained in the <hi>firſt Canon,</hi> or to beat themſelues, or elſe to ſuffer themſelues for their penance to be beaten with rods, which was ordained in the <hi>ſecond Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non:</hi> and of this I neuer made doubt, but I did euer grant, that the <hi>Church</hi> hath authority by the inſtitution of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to impoſe, enioyne, or command temporall and corporall afflictions, penalties, or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but all the difficulty betwixt my <hi>Aduerſaries</hi> and mee, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>coerciue,</hi> compulſiue, or puniſhing power of the <hi>Church,</hi> that is, if they ſhould refuſe to obey the commandement of their <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours,</hi> and would not abſtaine from the acts of matrimony, nor beat themſelues, nor ſuffer themſelues to be beaten with rods, with what kinde of puniſhments could the <hi>Church,</hi> by her ſpirituall authority, which ſhee hath receiued from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> force and compell them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto; to wit, whether by <hi>inflicting</hi> vpon them temporall and corporall puniſhments, as my <hi>Aduerſaries</hi> contend, or only ſpirituall Cenſures,

by depriuing them either wholly, or in part of ſpirituall, or Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall communion, as many other <hi>Catholikes</hi> doe <hi>probably</hi> according to my doctrine affirme: this is the plaine, and maine controuerſie, as I haue often ſaid.</p>
            <p n="58">58 Neither can it be prooued by any of theſe <hi>Canons,</hi> that the <hi>coerciue,</hi> or compulſiue ſpirituall power of ſpirituall <hi>Paſtours,</hi> doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the inflicting of corporall, or temporall puniſhments, but onely of Eccleſiaſticall Cenſures, as it may ſufficiently appeare by the <hi>ſecond Canon</hi> heere cited, wherein is decreed, that <hi>Si ſeniores ipſorum co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonorum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If the more ancient of theſe husband-men</hi> (giuing thereby to vnderſtand, that the <hi>husband-men,</hi> who were to be whipped by the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> or their <hi>Miniſters</hi> for penance, were boyes or youths) <hi>ſhall take it in ill part, or will therefore vſe any reuenge, or ſhall preſume to defend them, that they be not beaten, they ſhall be puniſhed with the ſentence of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Excommunication.</hi> Wherefore thoſe wordes of this <hi>Canon, that they may doe penance against their wills,</hi> are not to bee vnderſtood, <hi>againſt their wills ſimply and abſolutely,</hi> by corporall force and violence, which taketh away all <hi>willingneſſe,</hi> for ſuch kind of <hi>penance,</hi> or ſatisfaction is not acceptable before almightie <hi>God,</hi> or of any merite at all before <hi>God,</hi> but they are to be vnderſtood <hi>againſt their wills, ſecundum quid,</hi> in ſome ſort, as Merchants againſt their wills, for feare of being drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned caſt their goods into the Sea, to wit, <hi>that they ſhall be compelled to doe penance, and ſuffer themſelues to be beaten against their wills,</hi> for feare of being otherwiſe thruſt out of the <hi>Church,</hi> and depriued of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call communion, which kinde of compulſion being <hi>ſimply voluntary,</hi>

               <hi>that the Reader may the better vnderſtand this matter, and the true ſenſe, and meaning of theſe two</hi> Gloſſes, <hi>it is to bee conſidered firſt, that the</hi> Gloſſes <hi>of the Law being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly very briefe (and therefore many times obſcure) are to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood according to the drift, ſenſe, and circumſtances, not only of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi> Canons <hi>gloſſed, but alſo of other</hi> Canons, <hi>and</hi> Gloſſes <hi>in other parts, and places of the Law.</hi>

            <p n="11">11 True it is, that when the <hi>Gloſſes,</hi> or expoſitions of the law are obſcure, as being commonly briefe (although not ſo briefe, and for this reſpect not ſo obſcure, as the law it ſelfe, for to little purpoſe were that <hi>Gloſſe,</hi> or expoſition, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is more obſcure then the text it ſelfe) we muſt gather the ſenſe, &amp; meaning of ſuch <hi>Gloſſes</hi> from the drift, ſenſe, &amp; circumſtances not only of the particular <hi>Canons</hi> gloſſed, but alſo of other <hi>Canons</hi> and Gloſſes of the ſame <hi>Expoſitour,</hi> or <hi>gloſſer,</hi> in other parts, and places of the law; but with this <hi>caueat</hi> and <hi>prouiſo,</hi> that if the ſame <hi>Gloſſer</hi> or <hi>Expoſitour</hi> bring two diuers or contrarie <hi>Expoſitions</hi> of the ſame <hi>Canon,</hi> which are grounded vpon two <hi>contrary</hi> opinions, we muſt haue a regard to diſtinguiſh theſe two <hi>contrary</hi> opinions, and the <hi>Gloſſes</hi> grounded thereon, and for the vnderſtanding of the <hi>Gloſſe,</hi> or expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ſuppoſeth one opinion, not to flye to that <hi>Gloſſe,</hi> which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the contrary doctrine and opinion, for otherwiſe we ſhall make the ſenſe and meaning of the <hi>Gloſſes</hi> to be more obſcure, and intricate, then plaine, and manifeſt.

But with all this difference is to be obſerued betwixt theſe two puniſhments, that although ſome Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall perſons, as diuers <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> being <hi>temporall Princes,</hi> haue authority to <hi>inflict</hi> both kinde of puniſhments, and to hang and draw, as our <hi>Engliſh</hi> prouerbe ſaith, within their temporall Dominions, yet <hi>Eccleſiaſticall leuitie,</hi> as Saint <hi>Leo</hi> ſaith, <hi>doth ſhun theſe bloudy puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and the <hi>Canons</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> doe forbid Cleargie-men to vſe the ſame and to pronounce the ſentence of death againſt any malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour whatſoeuer, immediately by themſelues, but onely by their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.

So that if a Cleargie-man, who is a <hi>temporall Prince,</hi> as are the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>Collen,</hi> and <hi>Ments</hi> ſhould, notwithſtanding the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of the Church, pronounce the ſentence of death againſt any malefactour, who deſerueth the ſame, although hee ſhould offend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the prohibition of the <hi>Church,</hi> yet he ſhould not offend againſt iuſtice, vſurping the power which he hath not, &amp; by doing that which for want of temporall iuriſdiction he hath no authority to doe, in that manner as an other man, who hauing no temporall iuriſdiction, and condemning one to death, ſhould offend.</p>

For although it litle importeth, whether a <hi>Biſhop</hi> may inflict a pecuniarie penaltie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Lay-man that is not his temporall ſubiect, or make it to be infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the <hi>Secular Iudge</hi> by forcing the <hi>Iudge</hi> thereunto, not onely by ſpirituall, but alſo by temporall compulſion, or coercion, ſeeing that in this caſe it is done by the <hi>Biſhops</hi> authoritie, and the <hi>Seculiar Iudge</hi> is but his <hi>inſtrument,</hi> and <hi>Miniſter</hi> to <hi>execute</hi> his will, yet that a <hi>Biſhop</hi> may on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make a pecuniarie penaltie to be inflicted by a <hi>Seculiar Iudge</hi> by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing him thereunto by <hi>Eccleſiasticall Cenſures,</hi> and not by temporall compulſion, this doth very much import, and altogether fauour my doctrine.

            <p n="61">61 Wherefore this <hi>indirect</hi> temporall power, authoritie, domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or iuriſdiction, is in my opinion a <hi>meere fiction,</hi> purpoſely inuented without ſufficient ground by the <hi>later Diuines,</hi> to put a more colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable cloake vpon this pretended temporall authoritie of the <hi>Pope,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſaw the <hi>Canoniſts</hi> doctrine, making the <hi>Pope</hi> a temporall <hi>Monarch</hi> of the whole world, to be very falſe, abſurd, ſcandalous, and odious both to <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>ſubiects;</hi> and yet in effect or ſubſtance they differ little, or nothing at all: For whatſoeuer the <hi>Canoniſts</hi> grant, that the <hi>Pope</hi> may doe in temporalls <hi>directly,</hi> the <hi>Diuines</hi> grant he may doe <hi>indirectly,</hi> which doth in effect as much as the former derogate from the <hi>Soueraigntie</hi> of <hi>abſolute Princes:</hi> for it little importeth to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the matter, whether the <hi>Pope</hi> may depoſe hereticall, or wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>Princes</hi> by a power, or dominion ouer temporals, which muſt bee called <hi>temporall,</hi> or by a power, which muſt bee called <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> ſo that he may depoſe them; or whether the <hi>Pope</hi> bee ſuperiour to abſolute <hi>Princes</hi> in temporals, <hi>directly,</hi> or <hi>indirectly,</hi> ſo that they muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge themſelues not to be <hi>abſolute,</hi> but ſubiect to the <hi>Pope</hi> in tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals. But as I haue ſignified heeretofore, all the difficultie, and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guitie of theſe words, <hi>directly,</hi> and <hi>indirectly</hi> will preſently appeare, and the whole miſt, which the <hi>Diuines</hi> by this diſtinction doe caſt ouer the eyes of the vnlearned, wil foorthwith vaniſh away, if we will but duly conſider the difference betwixt the <hi>directiue,</hi> and <hi>coerciue</hi> power, and the proper acts, and obiects of either of them.</p>
            <p n="62">62 For as in all arts, ſciences, faculties, and powers, whatſoeuer is <hi>directly</hi> contained vnder the <hi>formall</hi> obiect of that art, ſcience, facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or power, is <hi>directly</hi> ſubiect to that art, ſcience, facultie or power, ſo what thing ſoeuer, whether it be temporall, or ſpirituall, is <hi>directly</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained vnder the <hi>formall</hi> obiect of the <hi>directiue</hi> or <hi>coerciue</hi> power, is <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly</hi> ſubiect to that power. Seeing therefore that the proper acts, and formall obiects (by which all powers are diſtinguiſhed) of the <hi>ſpirituall directiue,</hi> or commanding power, are the commanding of vertue, and the forbidding of vice, from hence it followeth, that all actions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, whether they be ſpirituall, or temporall, as they are vertuous, or vicious actions, and neceſſary, or hurtfull to the ſpirituall, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall good of ſoules, are <hi>directly</hi> ſubiect to the ſpirituall <hi>directiue</hi> power. So that the reference, or relation of temporall actions, to the ſpirituall good of ſoules, doth nothing hinder, but rather is a cauſe, that, as they are vertuous, or vicious actions, they are <hi>directly</hi> ſubiect to the ſpirituall <hi>directiue</hi> power.</p>
            <p n="63">

For what <hi>Diuine,</hi> or <hi>Phyloſopher</hi> can deny, that all thoſe things whatſoeuer, which doe truly participate the definition, or nature of the <hi>formall</hi> obiect of any art, ſcience, facultie, or power, by what meanes, or conſideration ſoeuer they doe participate the ſame, are <hi>directly</hi> ſubiect to that art, ſcience, facultie, or power? And in the ſame proportionate manner, as theſe men ſay, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath an <hi>indirect</hi> temporall <hi>directiue</hi> power, or authoritie ouer temporall things, it may bee ſaid, that temporall <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> haue an <hi>indirect</hi> ſpirituall <hi>directiue</hi> power ouer ſpirituall things: for that as the <hi>Pope</hi> doth forbid temporall things, not as they are tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, but as they are ſpirituall, and hurtfull to the good of ſoules; ſo temporall <hi>Princes</hi> may forbid ſpirituall things, as Hereſie, Schiſme, periurie, miniſtring of Sacraments with a poyſoned matter, whereby danger of death doth enſue, not as they are ſpirituall, but as they are temporall wrongs, and hurtfull to the publike peace in the Common-wealth, which is the <hi>formall obiect</hi> of the temporall <hi>directiue</hi> power. So that this diſtinction of <hi>directly,</hi> and <hi>indirectly,</hi> cannot bee well applied to the ſpiritual <hi>directiue</hi> power, but that in the like proportionate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, it may be alſo applied to the temporall <hi>directiue</hi> power, dominion, and Iuriſdiction.</p>
            <p n="64">64 And as concerning the Eccleſiaſticall <hi>coerciue</hi> power, we muſt diſcourſe in the ſame manner: and likewiſe conſider, what are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per acts, and <hi>formall</hi> obiects of this power, as it is <hi>coerciue,</hi> or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: for whatſoeuer doth participate the nature and definition of the acts, and obiects of this power is directly ſubiect thereunto.

            <p n="23">23 But this obiection is as friuolous as the former; firſt, for that it ſuppoſeth that I oppoſe a matter of fact, to a matter of faith, and i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine that the one cannot ſtand with the other, which is vntrue, as I ſhewed before.

               </note> as you may ſee in <hi>Alphonſus de Caſtro,</hi> and Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> were not accounted heretikes for celebrating the Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> according to the cuſtome of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> contrary to the decree of the Church, but for that they thought it neceſſary to celebrate that Feaſt, according to the cuſtome of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> which is indeede <hi>hereticall.</hi> And therefore that is very vntrue, which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> ſaith, <hi>that the</hi> Quartadecimani <hi>were worthily held for heretikes, becauſe they did obſtinately refuſe to obey thoſe decrees,</hi> but becauſe they refuſed to obey them vpon an hereticall ground.

<pb n="486" facs="tcp:150436:261"/>
one thing to ſay, that the Church may erre in making ſuch, or ſuch a law, and decree; and another thing to ſay, that the Church doth erre, or hath erred in making that law and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,<note place="margin">Canus lib. <hi>5.</hi> q. <hi>5</hi> conclu. <hi>2.</hi>

            <p n="25">25 As alſo it is no falſe doctrine, much leſſe <hi>hereticall,</hi> to affirme, that <hi>Kings,</hi> and temporall Common-wealths may erre in making lawes and decrees concerning ciuill gouernment, for that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath not promiſed them his infallible aſſiſtance therein; yet it were <hi>ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,</hi> and <hi>ſeditious</hi> for a priuate man to impugne any temporall law eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by the <hi>Prince,</hi> and the Common-wealth, and to ſay, that they did erre in making that temporall law. But, as I ſaid before, I doe not <hi>impugne,</hi> but onely <hi>expound</hi> this Decree, or rather <hi>Act</hi> of the <hi>Lateran Councell,</hi> according to the probable doctrine of <hi>very many Doctours,</hi> who affirme, that the <hi>Church</hi> by the inſtitution of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> hath not power to <hi>inflict</hi> temporall puniſhments, but onely Eccleſiaſticall Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.

               </note>4 His <hi>third</hi> argument is this: <hi>It is a poynt of Faith that the</hi> Church <hi>cannot erre in doctrine, and precepts of manners, by teaching generally any thing to be lawfull, which is vnlawfull, or vnlawfull which is lawfull, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by commanding any thing which is,</hi> per ſe, <hi>of it ſelfe vnlawfull: for ſuch an errour is no leſſe pernicious to the faithfull, then is an errour in faith. But if the</hi> Pope <hi>ſhould not haue that authority to depriue temporall</hi> Princes <hi>of their dominions, the</hi> Church <hi>ſhould erre in doctrine of manners, and that in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of very great moment: For ſhee teacheth, that after a</hi> Prince <hi>is depoſed by the</hi> Popes <hi>authority, all his ſubiects are abſolued from his obedience, and that his dominions may bee taken by another, as it is manifest by the</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells: <hi>Alſo, that after a</hi> Prince <hi>is publikely excommunicated, his ſubiects are abſolued from their</hi> Oath <hi>of</hi> Allegiance, <hi>in ſo much that they are not bound to obey him vntill hee he reconciled, yea and ſhe doth forbid them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him, if the Cenſure be denounced. All which ſhall be falſe, and not onely falſe, but alſo pernicious, for that the ſubiects ſhall thereby be incited to rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions and periuries, yea and againſt their will be compelled thereunto: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the</hi> Church <hi>doth erre in doctrine of manners, and commandeth rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and periuries, and by her Cenſures doth compell men thereunto, but to affirme this is</hi> hereticall, <hi>therefore that alſo from whence this followeth,</hi> is hereticall, <hi>to wit, that the</hi> Church <hi>hath not authority to abſolue ſubiects from the bond of their</hi> oath, <hi>and from their obedience.</hi>

            <p n="35">35 If therefore when M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert,</hi> taxing mee moſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly of ridiculous abſurditie, doeth ſo confidently affirme it to bee <hi>euident, that many things may ſeeme vncertaine to ſome learned men, and yet bee moſt certaine to the Sea Apoſtolike,</hi> his meaning bee, that the <hi>Sea Apoſtolike</hi> hath this certaine knowledge by publike reuelation, or by ſome neceſſarie conſequence, which is euidently deduced from publike reuelation, I cannot poſſibly ſee how this can bee true; for that publike reuelations, and thoſe things, which are euidently dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from publike reuelations, are not proper onely to the <hi>Pope,</hi> but are common alſo to other learned men; and therefore alſo other lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, who are as skilfull, and perchance farre more skilfull in the knowledge of the holy Scriptures, and of publike reuelations, tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, definitions, declarations, and of the generall conſent, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of the Church, then thoſe <hi>Popes</hi> are may haue as certaine a knowledge of things ſupernaturall, and reuealed by publike reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as thoſe <hi>Popes</hi> either haue, or morally can haue.</p>

            <p n="46">46 <hi>Secondly,</hi> there is a great diſparity betwixt the examples, which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> heere bringeth concerning the lawfulneſſe of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring Sacraments vpon a probable opinion, and the example which I brought concerning the licences graunted by ſome <hi>Popes</hi> to inferiour <hi>Prieſts,</hi> to adminiſter the Sacrament of <hi>Confirmation.</hi> For the common doctrine and practiſe among Catholikes is, that it is not lawfull to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter vpon a probable opinion thoſe Sacraments mentioned by my <hi>Aduerſary,</hi> but in caſe of neceſſitie, and when the neceſſitie is paſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was vncertaine, or doubtfull, whether they were valid, and had effect or no, to reiterate them againe, vpon condition, according to that doctrine which is certaine, and without all controuerſie, doubt, or danger: But neither doe <hi>Popes</hi> giue licence to inferiour <hi>Prieſts</hi> to miniſter the Sacrament of <hi>Confirmation</hi> onely in time of neceſſitie, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

is it the common practiſe among Catholikes to reiterate againe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the neceſſitie is paſt, the Sacrament of <hi>Confirmation</hi> miniſtred by thoſe Prieſts, of whom there is a great controuerſie among learned Catholikes, whether the <hi>Pope</hi> hath authority to giue them any ſuch li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence or no.</p>

               <hi>that Pope</hi> Sixtus <hi>the fourth made a</hi> Decree <hi>concerning the celebration of the B.</hi> Virgins Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>notwithſtanding that it is vncertaine, and diſputed amongſt the Diuines without any blot of hereſie, errour, or mortall ſinne, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the bleſſed <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgin cantracted originall ſinne in her</hi> Conception, <hi>or was preſerued from it by a peculiar prouidence of God,</hi>

               <hi>and therefore ſaith he,</hi> it is manifeſt, that the Doctrine, which is either propoſed, or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the <hi>Pope,</hi> as the foundation of his <hi>Apoſtolicall Decree,</hi> and Conſtitution (concerning euen the religious worſhip of God) is not ſo certaine and vndoubtedly true, but that it may be impugned without danger of grieuous ſinne. <hi>So he: whereupon he inferreth, that the ground of the</hi> Canon <hi>of the</hi> Lateran Councell <hi>may alſo be vncertaine, or impugned without note of hereſie, or ſinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 But <hi>firſt</hi> it is very vntrue that this was my <hi>ſecond inſtance,</hi> which I brought to confront with Fa. <hi>Leſsius</hi> his <hi>ſecond argument,</hi> although it be true, that it was my <hi>ſecond</hi> example, whereon both my <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> inſtance were grounded. For whereas Fa. <hi>Leſsius</hi> to proue that the <hi>Popes</hi> power to depoſe <hi>Princes</hi> doth belong to faith, argueth thus in his <hi>ſecond</hi> argument; <hi>If a generall</hi> Councell <hi>ſhould expreſly define, that the Church hath power to depoſe</hi> Princes, <hi>no Catholike can make doubt, but that it ſhould belong to faith, but ſeeing that ſhe ſuppoſeth it as a certaine founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her Decrees and ſentences ſhee is thought no leſſe to affirme the ſame, therefore it ought to bee accounted no leſſe certaine:</hi> To this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I oppoſed an other <hi>inſtance</hi> not much vnlike to it, which was this: If the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould expreſly define, that he hath authoritie to giue licence to inferiour Prieſts to adminiſter the Sacrament of <hi>Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and to diſpence in the ſolemne vow of Chaſtitie, or that the B. <hi>Virgin</hi> was not conceiued in originall ſinne, none of thoſe Catholikes

that hold as Fa. <hi>Leſsius</hi> doth, that the <hi>Pope</hi> cannot erre in his definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons although hee define without a generall <hi>Councell,</hi> can make any doubt, but that the aforeſaid things ſhould appertaine to faith, but ſeeing that diuers <hi>Popes</hi> doe ſuppoſe the ſame, as a certaine founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Decrees and ſentences, they are thought no leſſe to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the ſame, therefore they ought to be accounted no leſſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. This was my <hi>ſecond inſtance:</hi> and therefore M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> in affirming my <hi>ſecond example</hi> to be my <hi>ſecond inſtance</hi> diſcouereth no leſſe his fraude, then he doth both his fraude and ignorance in impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſame.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is alſo very vntrue, that I from this example infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as this man ſhamefully affirmeth, that the ground of the Canon of the <hi>Lateran Councell</hi> may alſo be vncertaine and impugned without note of hereſie, or ſinne, ſeeing that it is euident, as you haue ſeene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that I neither impugned, but onely expounded the <hi>Canon,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Act</hi> of the <hi>Lateran Councell,</hi> neither did I apply any one of thoſe <hi>three examples</hi> to the <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Lateran</hi> Councell, or in any one of my <hi>three inſtances</hi> made any mention of the <hi>Lateran</hi> Councell at all. But as Fa. <hi>Leſsius</hi> referred his <hi>ſecond</hi> argument to the foundations not onely of the <hi>Decrees</hi> of depoſition, as he ſuppoſeth this decree of the <hi>Lateran</hi> Councell to be, but alſo of the <hi>ſentences</hi> of generall <hi>Councells,</hi> as in his opinion was that denounced againſt <hi>Frederike</hi> the ſecond, by Pope <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi> the fourth, in the preſence of the Councell of <hi>Lyons,</hi> ſo alſo I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred my <hi>ſecond Inſtance,</hi> to the foundations of <hi>Popes</hi> D crees and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, vpon whom all the infallibility of the Church, according to his doctrine, doth depend. And the ſame anſwere, which my <hi>Aduerſaries</hi> ſhall giue to my <hi>ſecond inſtance,</hi> will forthwith ſatisfie Fa. <hi>Leſsius</hi> his <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond argument.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 For all the difficulty thereof, as alſo of his former argument, conſiſteth in this, whether euery doctrine which <hi>Popes,</hi> and <hi>Councells</hi> ſuppoſe as a ground and foundation of their <hi>Decrees,</hi> and <hi>ſentences,</hi> is alwaies to be accounted a certaine, and infallible ground, and not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to errour, or it may ſometimes bee onely a probable ground, and not alwayes an infallible point of faith: and my <hi>ſecond Inſtance</hi> doth ſufficiently conuince, that it is not alwaies a certaine, and infallible ground, whereby Fa. <hi>Leſsius</hi> his argument is quite ouerthrowne. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, the ground and foundation onely of thoſe Decrees of <hi>Popes,</hi> or generall <hi>Councells</hi> can be certaine and infallible, which are made by ſpirituall, and not temporall authoritie, as I haue ſaid before, ſo that this argument of Fa. <hi>Leſſius</hi> can little concerne the decree or Act of the <hi>Lateran Councell,</hi> touching the depoſition not of temporall <hi>Princes,</hi> but onely of inferiour Magiſtrates, and Lords, ſeeing that it was made by the conſent and authority of temporall <hi>Princes,</hi> to whom onely, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

to the probable doctrine of <hi>very many Doctours,</hi> the inflicting of temporall puniſhments, as of death, exile, priuation of goods, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, doth belong.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Now let vs ſee what M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> can ſay againſt this <hi>ſecond example,</hi> which he would make his Reader belieue to be my <hi>ſecond In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.

               <hi>that the</hi> bleſſed Virgin <hi>was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in originall ſinne, whereas no ſuch thing can be gathered by the decree, but onely that his deſire was by the conceſſion of</hi> Indulgences, <hi>to ſtirre vp the people to the deuote celebration of the Feaſt, and thereby to giue thankes, and praiſe to Almighty God for the benefite, which all Criſtian men haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by her</hi> Conception; <hi>to which end it imported nothing at all how ſhe was conceiued; I meane, whether ſhe were ſanctified in the first inſtant of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, as very many doe hold, or ſhortly after, as others teach, and therefore the decree of Pope</hi> Sixtus <hi>is obſerued as well by thoſe that affirme her to haue beene conceiued in originall ſinne, as by thoſe that denye it, becauſe nothing is ordained in the decree in fauour,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. <hi>§.</hi> Graue nimis.</note> 
               <hi>or preiudice of either opinion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 <hi>This may appeare as well by a latter</hi> Decree <hi>of his, whereby hee or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained that both the opinions might be held, and taught without note of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie</hi> (becauſe, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> the queſtion is not determined, and decided by the Church) <hi>as alſo by the expreſſe words of this</hi> Decree, <hi>wherein hee ſignifieth that conſidering the ineffable dignity, and worthineſſe of the moſt bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, it is conuenient and neceſſary that all faithfull Chriſtians</hi> giue praiſe and thanks to God for her <hi>meruellous</hi> conception,<note place="margin">Note that word <hi>meruailous.</hi>
               </note> to the end that by her merits, and interceſſion they may be made more capable of Gods grace. <hi>Thus ſaith Pope</hi> Sixtus <hi>in his</hi> Decree, <hi>and then addeth,</hi> Hac igitur conſideratione inducti, &amp;c. Therefore beeing moued with this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, we determine and decree, &amp;c. <hi>So he. And his determination and</hi> Decree <hi>was no other, but that all ſuch as did with due deuotion aſſiſt at the diuine office and ſeruice, appointed for the celebration of that</hi> Feaſt, <hi>ſhould gaine all thoſe</hi> Indulgences, <hi>which had beene granted before to ſuch as cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated the Feaſt of</hi> Corpus Chriſti.</p>
            <p n="5">5 <hi>This then being the whole ſubſtance and effect as well of the</hi> Decree <hi>as of the motiue thereof expreſſed therein, it is euident that Pope</hi> Sixtus <hi>had no other meaning in all this, then to mooue all Christians to the deuout cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the feast of the</hi> conception <hi>of the bleſſed</hi> Virgin, <hi>no leſſe then of her</hi> Natiuity, <hi>and other</hi> Feaſts, <hi>without any preiudice to the different opinions that eyther then were, or after might be held concerning the manner of her</hi> conception; <hi>in which respect the ſaid</hi> Feaſt <hi>is celebrated by all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians no leſſe then her other</hi> Feaſts, <hi>which is as much as Pope</hi> Sixtus <hi>deſired
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:150436:281"/>
and intended; whereby it appeareth, that his</hi> Decree <hi>is indifferent to both opinions, being obſerued by the maintainers of both, and that therefore it is not grounded vpon either of both.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6 <hi>And now to apply this to our purpoſe, whereas</hi> Widdrington <hi>preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth by this</hi> Inſtance <hi>to prooue, that the doctrine of the</hi> Popes <hi>power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe</hi> Princes <hi>is as vncertaine, as the doctrine that the</hi> B. Virgin <hi>was concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued without originall ſinne, which is impugned by very learned men, it is to be conſidered, that there is ſuch diſparitie in the caſes, and ſuch weakeneſſe in his</hi> Inſtance, <hi>that hee prooueth nothing at all againſt vs. For the</hi> Decree <hi>of Pope</hi> Sixtus <hi>had ſo little dependance on the doctrine of her immaculate</hi> Conception, <hi>that he might haue made it (yea it would haue been very law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, iuſt, and conuenient) though he had held the contrary opinion; whereby it is manifeſt, that his opinion concerning the immaculate puritie of her</hi> Conception <hi>was not the ground of his</hi> Decree (<hi>as</hi> Widdrington <hi>doth very fondly ſuppoſe it to bee) whereas in our queſtion touching the Canon of the Lateran</hi> Councell <hi>the caſe is farre different, ſeeing that the ſaid Canon hath ſuch dependance on the doctrine of the</hi> Popes <hi>power to depoſe</hi> Princes <hi>(which is neceſſarily ſuppoſed and included in it) that if the</hi> Pope <hi>haue no ſuch power, the Canon is vtterly void, being altogether vniuſt, vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and erroneous; Whereupon it euidently followeth, that the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the</hi> Popes <hi>power to depoſe</hi> Princes, <hi>is the foundation of the Canon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7 <hi>So as you ſee, that to impugne this vndoubted ground of the</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, <hi>hee is faine to ſuppoſe, and vrge a falſe ground of Pope</hi> Sixtus <hi>his</hi> decree, <hi>and conſequently faileth wholly in the proofe of that which he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth; and therefore to make his</hi> Inſtance <hi>good, and the caſes like, he ſhould haue prooued, that the doctrine of the</hi> Popes <hi>power to inſtitute</hi> Feaſts <hi>is vncertaine, and imagined by learned Catholikes without danger of ſinne, for Pope</hi> Sixtus <hi>his</hi> Decree <hi>touching the celebration of the</hi> Feaſt <hi>ſuppoſeth the truth of that doctrine, as in like ſort the</hi> Canon <hi>of the</hi> Lateran <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell concerning the depoſition of</hi> Princes <hi>ſuppoſeth that the doctrine of the</hi> Popes <hi>power to deſpoſe</hi> Princes <hi>is certaine, and true; and therefore I conclude, that his</hi> ſecond Inſtance, <hi>wherein he ſuppoſeth a falſe ground, is as improbable, and impertinent as the former.</hi>

            <p n="9">9 <hi>But at the last</hi> (ſaith <hi>Suarez</hi> to proue from the authority of the Church, that the bleſſed <hi>Virgin</hi> was preſerued from originall ſin, and ſanctified in the firſt inſtant of her conception) <hi>the Church</hi> of Rome <hi>two hundred yeeres ſince generally receauing the celebration of this Feaſt, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth speciall indulgences to the worſhippers thereof: Whereupon ſhe ſeemeth in ſome ſort to haue canonized the</hi> conception <hi>of the</hi> bleſſed Virgin. <hi>But perchance it will be ſaid, that this</hi> conception <hi>is not celebrated, for that it is holy, but becauſe it hath beene a great benefit of</hi> God, <hi>and a beginning of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

            <p n="12">12 So as you ſee how Fa. <hi>Suarez</hi> not only ſaith, but alſo proueth, that the end, reaſon, ground, and foundation of Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> his decree touching the celebration of the Feaſt of the B. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgins Conception,</hi> was for that the <hi>Pope</hi> ſuppoſed, that ſhee was ſanctified in the firſt inſtant of her <hi>Conception.</hi> And the ſame reaſons Fa. <hi>Vaſquez</hi> alſo bringeth. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hee vrgeth another reaſon taken from the wordes of the <hi>Decree</hi> of Pope <hi>Sixtus,</hi> and related aboue by my <hi>Aduerſarie,</hi> to wit, <hi>that the</hi> Pope <hi>in that</hi> Decree <hi>exhorteth the faithfull to giue praiſe and thankes to</hi> God <hi>for the</hi> wonderfull, <hi>or</hi> meruailous Conception <hi>of the immaculate</hi> Virgin, <hi>but hee could not call it a</hi> wonderfull, <hi>or</hi> meruailous Conception, <hi>vnleſſe the</hi> B.

            </p>
            <p n="13">13 Iudge now, <hi>good Reader,</hi> whether this raſh-headed ignorant man may not be aſhamed to condemne ſo raſhly the moſt famous, and learnedſt men of his owne <hi>Societie,</hi> as hee condemneth mee, of <hi>fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, improbabilitie, and impertinencie,</hi> for affirming ſo reſolutely, that <hi>without all doubt the end, reaſon, ground and foundation of</hi> Pope Sixtus his <hi>Decree for celebrating the Feast of the</hi> B.

<pb n="530" facs="tcp:150436:283"/>
to</hi> God <hi>for her</hi> holy <hi>and</hi> wonderfull Conception, <hi>and contrarie to the ordinarie manner that other men are conceiued, to the end that they thus celebrating her</hi> holy <hi>and</hi> meruailous Conception <hi>may by her merits, and interceſſion bee made more capable of</hi> Gods <hi>grace.</hi> But perchance M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> hath not read theſe Authours, and then his ignorance and raſhneſſe is the more blame worthie in taking vpon him to bee a tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and Cenſurer of others in theſe points of Schoole-Diuinitie, wherein hee ſheweth himſelfe to bee ſo ignorant; and if hee haue read them, then his fraude is the more culpable to delude his <hi>Reader</hi> ſo ſhamefully in bringing arguments againſt their doctrine, to taxe it of fondneſſe, improbabilitie, and impertinencie, and in diſſembling in what manner they haue moſt cleerely confuted the ſame. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou needeſt not much meruaile to heare theſe wordes ſo frequent in this mans mouth, that my arguments, and anſweres are abſurd, improbable, impertinent, fooliſh, ridiculous, malicious, erroneous, yea and hereticall, and then moſt commonly when they are moſt ſound and ſufficient, and his Replyes moſt weake and fraudulent, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with what a bold face the ſilly ignorant man doth vnlearnedly &amp; arrogantly condemne in me &amp; my doctrine, of fondnes, improbabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and impertinencie, the moſt famous Diuines of his own Societie.</p>
            <p n="14">14 And whereas M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> ſtill harpeth vpon the ſame ſtring, to wit, that the vndoubted ground and foundation of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree</hi> of the <hi>Lateran</hi> Councell is, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath power to depoſe <hi>Princes,</hi> and that the <hi>Canon</hi> ſuppoſeth this doctrine to be certaine, this is the maine point about which wee contend, for I haue euer denyed, and hee hath no way ſufficiently prooued, but ſuppoſed, that this <hi>decree,</hi> or rather <hi>Act</hi> of the <hi>Lateran</hi> Councell doeth concerne the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of temporall <hi>Princes,</hi> but onely of inferiour Magiſtrates, Land-Lords, or Lords, by the conſent and authoritie of temporall <hi>Princes,</hi> from whom that <hi>Act</hi> had force to bind. And although the <hi>Popes</hi> power to inſtitute Feaſts bee a remote ground and foundation of the decree of Pope Sixtus, yet the immediate ground &amp; foundation of that <hi>Decree</hi> was the puritie and ſanctitie of the B. <hi>Virgins Conception,</hi> in honour whereof hee did inſtitute that Feaſt, as I haue ſhewed before. And albeit I doe not deny that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath authoritie to inſtitute Feaſts in the honour of Saints, and of ſacred myſteries, yet I deny that the end, reaſon, ground and foundation for which ſuch Feaſts are inſtituted, is alwayes certaine and infallible, and that thoſe myſteries are therefore infallibly ſacred, as in this Feaſt of the B. <hi>Virgins Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> it is apparant by the teſtimonies of moſt famous, and learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines. And laſtly, although I doe not deny, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to canonize Saints, or to declare them to be holy and bleſſed men, yet <hi>Melchior Canus</hi> feareth not to ſay, <hi>that it is not hereticall to affirme,
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:150436:283"/>
that the</hi> Pope <hi>may erre therein,</hi> and the reaſon thereof hee giueth, as I declared before, becauſe the ground, whereon the <hi>Popes</hi> iudgement and declaration in ſuch canonizations doth rely, to wit, the teſtimonies of men, is fallible, and expoſed to errour.

the <hi>Decree,</hi> or rather <hi>Act</hi> of the <hi>Lateran</hi> Councell, neyther did I in any one of my <hi>three Inſtances,</hi> or alſo examples make mention at all of the <hi>Lateran</hi> Councell, nor alſo did I euer acknowledge, that the doctrine of the <hi>Popes</hi> power to depoſe <hi>Princes,</hi> was the ground and foundation of the Decree of the <hi>Lateran</hi> Councell. But for this cauſe I produced this example of <hi>Popes</hi> diſpenſations in the ſolemne vow of chaſtitie, to ſhew, that the ground and foundation, eſpecially of Popes ſentences of depoſition, as was that ſentence of <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 7. againſt <hi>Henrie</hi> the 4. in a Councell held at <hi>Rome,</hi> and of <hi>Innocent</hi> the 4. againſt <hi>Fredericke</hi> the ſecond in the Councell of <hi>Lyons,</hi> and other ſuch ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which concerne particular men, doth not appertaine to faith, by vertue of this propoſition, whereon both the firſt and ſecond argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Fa. <hi>Leſſius</hi> was principally grounded, <hi>That doctrine doth apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to faith, which</hi> Popes, <hi>and</hi> Councels <hi>ſuppoſe as a certaine foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their decrees and ſentences;</hi> for it is euident, that there is no more reaſon why the ground and foundation of <hi>Popes</hi> particular ſentences of depoſitions or puniſhments ſhould appertaine to faith, then of his particular grants of diſpenſations and priuiledges, whereby it appeareth euidently, that this was a fit example to confute Fa. <hi>Leſſius</hi> his firſt and ſecond argument, which there I tooke in hand in my firſt and ſecond <hi>Inſtance</hi> to confute.</p>
            <p n="18">18 Beſides, I brought this example in my third <hi>Inſtance,</hi> againſt Fa. <hi>Leſſius</hi> his third argument, whereby he laboured to prooue, that <hi>it is a poynt of faith that the Pope hath power to depoſe</hi> Princes, <hi>for</hi> that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Pope ſhould erre in doctrine and precepts of manners by teaching generally ſomething to be lawfull, which is vnlawfull, or contrariwiſe, and alſo by commanding ſomething of it ſelfe vnlawfull ſeeing that ſhe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, that a</hi> Prince <hi>being depoſed, yea, and excommunicated by the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the</hi> Pope, <hi>his ſubiects are abſolued from his obedience, yea, and are bound not to obey him, vntill he be reconciled, if the Cenſure bee denounced, whereby ſubiects are incited by the Pope to rebellions and periuries.</hi> Againſt this argument, I brought my third <hi>Inſtance,</hi> which my <hi>Aduerſary</hi> frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulently concealeth, and which was grounded not only vpon this third example of <hi>Popes</hi> licences giuen to Prieſts to Miniſter the Sacrament of <hi>Confirmation,</hi> and might likewiſe bee grounded vpon the ſecond of Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> his decree for the celebrating of the bleſſed <hi>Virgins</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>
            <p n="19">19 For if Fa. <hi>Leſſius</hi> his third argument be good, it may likewiſe be prooued, as you may ſee by my third <hi>Instance,</hi> that it is a poynt of faith that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath power to diſpence in the ſolemne vow of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity, to giue licence to <hi>Priests</hi> to miniſter the Sacrament of <hi>Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and alſo that the bleſſed <hi>Virgines</hi> Conception was pure, holy, and immaculate, ſeeing that from theſe diſpenſations, licences, and decree
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:150436:284"/>
of Pope <hi>Sixtus,</hi> it euidently followeth, that the Pope teacheth general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the marriage of profeſſed religious perſons is a true Sacrament, and the children begotten and borne by them are legitimate, and if the Parents be Kings, their children ought to be preferred in the Kindome before all others, who may pretend otherwiſe a right thereto, and the Sacrament of <hi>Confirmation,</hi> miniſtred by an inferiour Prieſt, with the Popes licence is a true and valid Sacrament, and alſo that the honour and worſhip which is giuen to the bleſſed <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgines</hi> conception is a true and religious honour; all which would according to Fa. <hi>Leſſius</hi> his third argument, bee falſe and pernicious, (becauſe the faithfull ſhould thereby be incited to commit iniuries, and ſacriledges, yea, and againſt their wils by Cenſures bee compelled thereunto) if the <hi>Pope</hi> hath no ſuch power to diſpence in the ſolemne vowe of chaſtity, nor to giue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to <hi>Prieſts</hi> to miniſter the Sacrament of <hi>Confirmation,</hi> and that the bleſſed <hi>Virgin</hi> was not in her Conception pure, holy, and imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate. But my <hi>Aduerſary</hi> to obſcure the whole difficulty, and to blinde the Readers vnderſtanding thought it beſt, not to ſet downe ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but in that lame manner, as you haue ſeene Fa. <hi>Leſſius</hi> his three ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, and wholy to conceale the three <hi>Inſtances</hi> I made againſt them, whereby hee might with a leſſe ſhew of falſity boldly affirme, that the three examples were my three <hi>Instances,</hi> and that they were brought by me of purpoſe to impugne the decree of the <hi>Lateran Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,</hi> both which how vntrue they are, and alſo of what little force are all Fa. <hi>Leſsius</hi> his three arguments, againſt which onely I brought my three <hi>Inſtances,</hi> you haue ſeene before.</p>
            <p n="20">20 For all the difficulty of Fa. <hi>Leſsius</hi> his third argument, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in the vnderſtanding of that <hi>Maior</hi> propoſition, <hi>It is a point of faith, that the Church cannot erre in doctrine, and precepts of manners, by teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generally ſomething to be lawfull, which is vnlawfull, or vnlawfull, which is lawfull, or alſo by commanding ſomething of it ſelfe vnlawfull.</hi> For if by doctrine of maners, &amp; teaching generally, he meane a <hi>definitiue</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or a propounding any thing, as of faith, with an obligation to bind all the faithfull to belieue that doctrine. I grant that it is a point of faith that the <hi>Church,</hi> or a generall <hi>Councell</hi> cannot erre in ſuch doctrine, or teaching, (for whether the Pope can erre or no in ſuch teaching, it is not a point of faith, but as yet a controuerſie betwixt the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Diuines) but then I vtterly deny that any generall <hi>Councell</hi> (yea, or any <hi>Pope</hi>) hath euer defined, or taught generally, that the <hi>Pope</hi> by vertue of his Eccleſiaſticall power hath authority to depoſe temporall <hi>Princes,</hi> to abſolue ſubiects from their temporall allegiance, or to inflict temporall puniſhments. But if by doctrine, and teaching he meane <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinatiue</hi> and probable doctrine and teaching, beſides that it cannot be conuinced that the <hi>Lateran Councell,</hi> or any other generall Councell
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:150436:285"/>
taught generally in this ſenſe, that the <hi>Pope</hi> by vertue of his ſpirituall power hath authority to depoſe temporall <hi>Princes,</hi> his <hi>Maior</hi> propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is very vntrue, and therefore from thence it doth not follow, that the doctrine of the <hi>Popes</hi> power to depoſe Princes, is certaine, and of faith.</p>
            <p n="21">21 Likewiſe, if by <hi>commanding ſomething of it ſelfe euill,</hi> Fa. <hi>Leſsius</hi> vnderſtand a <hi>generall commaundement,</hi> propounded to the whole Church, or all the faithfull, I grant alſo that a generall Councell can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre in impoſing ſuch <hi>generall commandements,</hi> although this be not ſo cleare a point of faith as the former, as I haue ſhewed before out of the doctrine of learned <hi>Canus;</hi> but then I deny, that any generall <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell</hi> hath euer giuen any ſuch <hi>generall commandement</hi> concerning all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, not to obey their temporall <hi>Prince,</hi> being depoſed by the <hi>Pope,</hi> or to rebell, and plot conſpiracies againſt him: But if by <hi>commanding,</hi> he vnderſtand <hi>particular</hi> decrees and commandements, propounded to particular perſons, Biſhops, Churches, or Kingdomes againſt any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Emperours, Kings, or temporall Princes then I ſay, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the doctrine of Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and <hi>Canus,</hi> the Church, and much more, the <hi>Pope</hi> may erre; and of this ſort are the depoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, iudiciall ſentences, and commandements of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth, in a Councell held at <hi>Rome</hi> againſt <hi>Henrie</hi> the fourth Emperor, of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the fourth, in the preſence of the Councell of <hi>Lyons</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Frederike</hi> the ſecond Emperour, and all other particular depoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of whatſoeuer Emperours, Kings, or temporall Princes: and in theſe <hi>commandements</hi> the <hi>Popes</hi> were euer reſiſted, and contradicted both by <hi>Princes</hi> themſelues, and alſo by learned and vertuous Catholike ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, as it appeareth euidently, not onely by the firſt depoſitions of Emperours, and Princes, but alſo by the two laſt, of our late Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and the laſt King of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> who were obeyed in ciuill mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by their Catholike ſubiects, &amp; acknowledged by them to be their true and rightfull Soueraignes, notwithſtanding the Popes particular declaration, ſentence, and commandement to the contrary, as I haue ſhewed at large concerning our late Queene, in the firſt part, and of the King of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> the late troubles and ciuill warres in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> which are yet both freſh in moſt mens memories, and recorded alſo by Hiſtories, are ſufficient teſtimonies.</p>
            <p n="22">22 Thus thou ſeeſt, <hi>good Reader,</hi> that neither by this <hi>third exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> of <hi>Popes</hi> diſpenſations in vowes, whereon not onely my <hi>third In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> but alſo the <hi>two</hi> former were grounded, all which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herbert</hi> hath fraudulently concealed, did I impugne the <hi>Decree</hi> of the <hi>Lateran</hi> Councell, as the ſilly man to make ſome ſhew of confuting them as <hi>abſurd, improbable, impertinent, fond,</hi> and <hi>ridiculous,</hi> doth moſt vntruely affirme; neither did I in any one of my examples, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances

make any mention at all of the ſaid <hi>Decree:</hi> ſeeing that I had before ſufficiently anſwered to this Decree, not by impugning, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by expounding it, and by clearely conuincing, that according to the probable doctrine of very many learned Catholikes, who are of opinion, that the <hi>Church</hi> cannot by her ſpirituall power inflict tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall puniſhments, it muſt, according to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherberts</hi> owne principles, who acknowledgeth, that <hi>all lawes, and decrees whatſoeuer are to be reſtrained and limited according to the power of the Law-Maker, &amp;c.</hi> be vnderſtood of the depoſing, not of temporall <hi>Princes,</hi> who are not ſubiect to the authoritie of the Church, foraſmuch as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth meere temporall matters, as is the inflicting of temporall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for what cauſe, crime, or end whatſoeuer they bee inflicted, but onely of inferiour Magiſtrates, Land-Lords, or Lords by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and authority of abſolute <hi>Princes;</hi> but that which I intended by my <hi>three</hi> examples, and inſtances was to ſhew the weakeneſſe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency of Fa. <hi>Leſſius</hi> his <hi>three arguments,</hi> as I haue ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared before.</p>

               <hi>and</hi> Canus) <hi>therefore the doctrine of the</hi> Popes <hi>power to depoſe</hi> Princes (<hi>whereupon the</hi> Canon <hi>of the</hi> Lateran Councell <hi>was grounded) is not ſo certaine but that it may be erroneous, and impugned without offence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 But ſo ſhamefull, and inſupportable is the corrupt dealing of this vnlearned and fraudulent man, that in very truth I am halfe aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to diſcouer and lay open the ſame. For <hi>firſt</hi> it is too too manifeſt, that I made no ſuch argument in this place, as this man faigneth, either concerning the <hi>Decree</hi> of the <hi>Lateran</hi> Councell, or concerning the <hi>Popes</hi> power to depoſe <hi>Princes,</hi> whereof here I made no mention at all. Neither alſo did I argue in this ridiculous manner, that becauſe the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which mooue Councells to define or determine any thing, are not ſo certaine as the decrees themſelues, therfore they may be impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned without offence: As who ſhould ſay, that becauſe there is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to <hi>Popes</hi> ſuch an infallibilitie, but that they may erre in their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate opinions, iudgements, diſpenſations, licences, Cenſures, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, therefore they doe erre in the ſame, and ſuch their opinions, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations &amp;c. may be impugned, and denied without offence. If M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> had ſaid <hi>without note of hereſie,</hi> he had ſaid ſomething to the purpoſe, and ſpoken agreeably to the grounds, which I maintaine, for what thing ſoeuer is not of faith, may be impugned, and denied without note of hereſie, but to ſay, without offence, this is too too ſhamefull and palpable a falſhood.</p>
            <p n="4">4 As for example, although <hi>Melchior Canus</hi> before related doth affirme, that <hi>it is not hereticall to hold, that the Church may erre in the cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization of Saints,</hi> for the reaſon, which I there alledged out of him, and conſequently, that he is not to be accounted an heretike, or an impugner of the Catholike faith, that ſhould therefore ſay, that the Church hath or doth erre in the canonization of ſuch a Saint, yet he affirmeth, that <hi>whoſoeuer ſhould ſay, that therefore the Church doth erre in the canonization of ſuch a Saint, is a raſh, and irreligious man, and deſerueth therefore to bee puniſhed by the Church:</hi> So likewiſe although it be certaine, that tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Princes,</hi> and common-wealths may erre in making temporall lawes through ignorance, inconſideration, or ſome intemperate affection,
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:150436:287"/>
and that therefore he is not to be reputed an <hi>heretike,</hi> who ſhould raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and without ſufficient ground affirme that they haue and doe erre in making ſuch temporall lawes, yet it is alſo certaine, that what ſubiect ſoeuer ſhould raſhly affirme, that his temporall <hi>Prince</hi> hath erred in making ſuch, or ſuch a law, and that ſuch or ſuch lawes are vniuſt, is worthily accounted an impious, ſcandalous, and turbulent perſon, and deſerueth therefore to be puniſhed by the State. So as you ſee how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny groſſe falſhoods this man hath impoſed vpon mee in ſo few lines.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Wherefore all the argument I made heere was, as you haue ſeene, onely this: The <hi>reaſons,</hi> ends, and motiues, for which <hi>Councells</hi> are moued, or induced to make definitions and decrees, are not alwayes ſo certaine and infallible, as the <hi>definitions</hi> or <hi>Decrees</hi> themſelues, but ſuch reaſons, ends, and motiues are propounded by the <hi>Councels</hi> as ſome grounds and foundations of their <hi>definitions,</hi> and <hi>decrees,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the grounds and foundations of Eccleſiaſticall <hi>definitions</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees</hi> are not ſo certaine, and infallible as the <hi>definitions</hi> &amp; <hi>decrees</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. Now what abſurdity, or impertinency, trow you, can be found in this my argument? For I neyther applyed it to the <hi>Lateran Councell,</hi> or to any other <hi>Decree</hi> of <hi>Pope,</hi> or <hi>Councell,</hi> or to the doctrine of the <hi>Popes</hi> power to depoſe <hi>Princes;</hi> neyther did I ſay, that becauſe the <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> of Eccleſiaſticall definitions, and decrees are ſometimes vncertain and fallible, therefore they may bee denied without offence: but all this is forged by my <hi>Aduerſary,</hi> that ſo hee might haue ſome co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to charge me with abſurdity and impertinency: for ſo exorbitant is the bitterneſſe of his zeale, not to vſe a more bitter word, that he will not haue me to ſay ſcarce any one thing throughout all my writings, without ſome note either of hereſie, errour, temerity, fraud, malice, irreuerence, ignorance, falſhood, impertinency, fondnes, or ridiculous abſurdity, from which imputations I haue neuertheleſſe cleared all my aſſertions, and euidently ſhewed, that they are farre more agreeable to his arguments, and anſweres. And if my <hi>Aduerſary</hi> had not beene blinded with ſome intemperate paſſion, he might plainely haue ſeene, that to no other end, &amp; purpoſe I brought that argument, but to ſhew, that the propoſition, whereon Fa. <hi>Leſſius</hi> grounded his <hi>two firſt</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereof I did treate immediately before, to wit, that the grounds, and foundations of Eccleſiaſticall decrees and ſentences muſt be certaine, infallible, and of faith, is not ſo generally true, but that it is needfull for Fa. <hi>Leſſius</hi> to make a more cleere explication thereof.</p>
            <p n="6">6 And albeit this be ſufficient to iuſtifie this my argument, and to free it from all imputation of abſurditie, and impertinencie, yet for the better ſatisfaction of the Reader I will examine more particularly what he excepteth againſt the ſame. Wherefore after he had ſo falſly and
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:150436:288"/>
fraudulently, as you haue ſeene, ſet downe the aforeſaid argument, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying it to the <hi>Popes</hi> power to depoſe <hi>Princes,</hi> and to the decree of the <hi>Lateran</hi> Councell, and alſo affirming me to ſay, that becauſe the <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> of Ecceſiaſticall Canons be ſometimes vncertaine, therefore they may be denied without offence, all which <hi>three</hi> things are forged by himſelfe, and not ſpoken by me, and therefore to colour his fraude the better he thought it beſt, not to ſet downe my argument verbatim, as there he found it, he writeth thus.<note n="a" place="margin">

               <hi>Whereunto I anſwere, that by this argument</hi> Widdrington <hi>impugneth none ſo much as himſelfe, granting that the Decrees of Councells may be certaine, though the reaſons, whereupon they are grounded, be vncertaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7 But as I doe not grant, that all the <hi>reaſons</hi> of Eccleſiaſticall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees are vncertaine, and not of faith, for ſome, no doubt, are certaine and of faith, ſo alſo I doe not grant, that all <hi>Decrees</hi> of Councells are certaine and of faith, for ſome no doubt are not of faith, ſeeing that <hi>all Decrees of Councells,</hi>

               </note> ſaith Cardinall Bellarmine, <hi>doe not belong to faith, but thoſe onely which are propounded as of faith;</hi> but of this I haue aboue treated more at large. So that if all <hi>decrees</hi> of Councells are not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, infallible, and of faith, no meruaile that the <hi>reaſons,</hi> grounds, and foundations of ſuch <hi>Decrees,</hi> as they are reaſons, grounds, and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof, may be vncertaine, fallible, and not of faith. I ſaid, <hi>as they are, reaſons, grounds, and foundations thereof,</hi> for if otherwiſe they be deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, definitions, or concluſions of ſome other generall Councell, in this reſpect they may be certaine, infallible, and of faith. And this doth euidently impugne the <hi>two firſt</hi> arguments of Fa. <hi>Leſsius,</hi> and the often named propoſition, whereupon they are grounded, but how by this argument I impugne none ſo much as my ſelfe (as this man ſaith, but doth not prooue) or any way impugne my ſelfe I cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend.</p>

and rules of Logike? <hi>Some Decrees of</hi> Councells <hi>may bee certaine, though the reaſons &amp; doctrine, whereupon they are grounded be vncertaine, therefore the</hi> Decree <hi>of the</hi> Lateran <hi>Councell ordaining the depoſition of</hi> Princes <hi>may be certaine, though the reaſons, doctrine, and foundations thereof, be vncertaine:</hi> As who ſhould ſay; Some men may be very skilfull in Diuinitie, although they neuer ſtudied it, to wit, by ſupernaturall infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and diuine reuelation, as <hi>Adam, Salomon,</hi> and our <hi>Sauiour Chriſt</hi> according to his humanitie; therefore M. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> may be very skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in Diuinitie, although he neuer ſtudied the ſame.</p>
            <p n="10">10 But <hi>ſecondly,</hi> it is not true, that the Councell of <hi>Lateran</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained the depoſition of <hi>Princes,</hi> but onely of inferiour Magiſtrates, Landlords, or Lords by the conſent and authority of temporall <hi>Princes:</hi> and therfore that <hi>Decree,</hi> or rather <hi>Act</hi> being not made by true Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall authoritie doth not appertaine to the preſent queſtion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the certaintie, &amp; infallibility of Eccleſiaſticall Decrees, which are made by the ſpirituall Paſtours of the Church, as they haue ſpirituall and not temporall authoritie. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> my <hi>Aduerſarie</hi> ſtanding in his own principles will haue much ado to proue, as I ſaid before, that thoſe words of the Councell, <hi>vt extunc ipſe &amp;c.

So that the more my <hi>Aduerſarie</hi> ſtriueth to prooue out of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid words of the <hi>Lateran</hi> Councell, that the doctrine of the <hi>Popes</hi> power to depoſe <hi>Princes</hi> is a point of faith, the more he bewraieth his owne ignorance, and the weakeneſſe of his cauſe, and the vncertaintie of his new broached Catholike faith.</p>

            <p n="14">14 But <hi>firſt,</hi> as concerning matters of beliefe, I grant with <hi>Canus,</hi> that it is certaine, and of faith, that the Church cannot erre, when ſhee propoundeth a doctrine of faith, with an obligation to binde all the faithfull to beleeue the ſame: and likewiſe in <hi>Decrees</hi> concerning ſuch manners and matters of fact, as are neceſſary to ſaluation, I grant alſo with the ſame <hi>Canus,</hi> that it is certaine, that ſhee cannot erre in making ſuch <hi>Decrees,</hi> for that conſequently it would follow, as <hi>Canus</hi> well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth, that ſhe may alſo erre in doctrine of faith: and ſo the Church cannot command any thing to all the faithfull, which is repugnant to the Goſpel, or to the law of nature.

haue ſome light how to iudge of this queſtion.

And the leardneſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines of his owne Societie, as <hi>Salmeron, Suarez,</hi> and <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Cenſure of this my raſh and ignorant <hi>Aduerſarie,</hi> are very abſurd and impertinent therein, doe conſtantly hold, that the <hi>fundamental reaſon</hi> of the Churches Decree concerning the celebration of the Feaſt of the B. <hi>

            <p n="15">15 <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is not certaine, that the Church now hath the ſame infallibility, in making Decrees concerning ſuch manners, and matters of fact as are not neceſſary to ſaluation, which the Apoſtles had in making ſuch Decrees, for that the iudgement of the Apoſtles being extraordinarily illuminated, and aſſiſted by the holy Ghoſt, did not onely depend vpon the relation, information, and iudgement of men, but alſo vpon the ſpeciall, and extraordinary aſſiſtance of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, and therefore from that Decree of the Apoſtles concerning the not eating of blood and ſtrangled meates, who were peculiarly and extraordinarily aſſiſted, and repleniſhed with the holy Ghoſt, and therefore might well ſay, <hi>Viſum est ſpiritui &amp; nobis,</hi>

            <p n="28">28 But truely I cannot but greatly pitty this poore mans caſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, I am much aſhamed to ſee and diſcouer his palpable fraud and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. For neither did I in thoſe three inſtances, or examples, or in this laſt argument make any mention at all of the decree of the <hi>Lateran Councell;</hi> neither did I intend to make any inference from them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that decree, neither did I euer graunt that the Church in the Councell of <hi>Lateran</hi> did ordaine, or decree, that Princes might in ſome caſes be depoſed by the Pope, but I alwaies affirmed, that the aforeſaid decree, or rather Act did onely concerne the depoſition of inferiour Magiſtrates or Lords, by the conſent and authority of abſolute Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp; that therfore that Act, or decree, was not made by meere Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall authority, and conſequently could not be a matter of faith, but of fact onely, as are all the decrees of temporall Princes concerning meere matters of fact. For although it be a matter of faith, that tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Princes haue authority to make temporall Lawes, yet it is not a matter of faith, that in making ſuch lawes they cannot erre, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their lawes are not matters of faith, but of fact onely; but the Church in making lawes to all the faithfull concerning ſuch matters of fact, or manners, which are neceſſary to ſaluation cannot erre by commanding anything which is contrary to the Goſpell, or the law of Nature, and therefore ſuch lawes are not onely matters of fact, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of faith.</p>
            <p n="29">29.

            <p n="32">32 But this obſeruation of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> is ſo childiſh, not to ſay ridiculous, that no Schoole-boy would argue in ſuch a childiſh manner: For what man that hath his wits about him, would make this concluſion, that his <hi>Aduerſary</hi> by his own ſentence, grant, &amp; confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is fallen into errour or hereſie, and to prooue the ſame bringeth <hi>two</hi>

propoſitions, whereof the one his <hi>Aduerſary</hi> doth indeed very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly grant, but the other which is the maine difficultie betweene them he vtterly denyeth.

For hee graunteth that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath no other authority to depoſe <hi>Princes,</hi> then that which was granted to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and his Succeſſours by thoſe wordes, <hi>I will giue thee the keyes, &amp;c.

            <p n="33">33. In this very like manner hee argueth againſt mee, to prooue that by my owne ſentence, graunt, and confeſſion, I am fallen into er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour or hereſie, for contemning and reiecting the voyce of the Church, in a generall Councell firmely beleeuing.

And therefore thoſe words of our <hi>Sauiour, Exore tuo te iudico ſerue nequam,</hi> may fitly be applied to himſelfe, who by his owne arguing ſheweth himſelfe to be a very ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, fraudulent, and ſlanderous man, in charging me to bee fallen

And for his <hi>fourth,</hi> and laſt obſeruation, he may ſee now that I haue performed my promiſe, and that without a perhaps, I haue confuted euery particular argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which hee hath brought againſt my doctrine, either in the <hi>two firſt</hi> Chapters of his <hi>Supplement,</hi> or in this his <hi>Reply</hi> againſt the anſwere I made to his arguments in that briefe <hi>Admonition;</hi> ſo that hee, or at leaſt the <hi>Reader</hi> may plainly perceiue, that the reaſon, why I did not then anſwere euery particular point of his Diſcourſe, was not for that I found therein any great difficultie, ſeeing that what there I ſaid <hi>it was more prolixe, then ſolid,</hi> I haue now conuinced to be true, but becauſe the breuitie of that ſhort <hi>Admonition</hi> or <hi>Preface,</hi> would not conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently permit me to anſwere more particularly ſo prolixe and verball Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="41">41 Wherefore I ſhall now expect what a learned <hi>Replie</hi> this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned man will make to ſaue his credit, and to cleare himſelfe of thoſe imputations of palpable fraude and ignorance, wherewith in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe I do often charge him, &amp; alſo of great want of charitie, as in the next Chapter you ſhall more cleerely ſee.

I gaue indeede, as you haue ſeene, <hi>two anſweres</hi> to his <hi>Holineſſe Breues</hi> which are briefly compriſed in thoſe few words <hi>[light foundations, and falſe informations.]</hi> My firſt and principall anſwere, which this fraudulent man altogeth concealeth, was this; that if his <hi>Holineſſe Breue</hi> forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Catholikes to take the Oath, for that it containeth many things flat contrarie to faith and ſaluation, was grounded vpon the <hi>Popes</hi> power to depoſe <hi>Princes,</hi> to diſpoſe of temporalls, to inflict temporall puniſhments, and to abſolue ſubiects from their temporall allegiance, as all my <hi>Aduerſaries</hi> grant it was chiefly grounded thereon, then I ſay it was not grounded vpon any certaine doctrine, infallible, and of faith, but vpon vncertaine and fallible grounds, and which were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes impugned by learned Catholikes, which vncertaine and fallible grounds I called light, for that they are not ſufficient and weightie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, let them be neuer ſo probable, to build thereon any certaine and infallible doctrine of faith, and which euery Catholike, vnleſſe
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:150436:306"/>
hee will deny his faith, is bound to follow. My ſecond anſwere, (which this man doth alſo in great part conceale, for that I did parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly ſet downe wherein his <hi>Holineſſe was miſinformed which he wholly diſſembleth) was, that if his Holineſſe Breue</hi> was grounded, as by all likelihood it was, vpon this foundation, that his power to <hi>excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,</hi> his power to bind and looſe in generall, and conſequently his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Supremacie, which according to the common doctrine of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes is indeede cleerely repugnant to faith, is denyed and impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Oath, then I ſay, that his <hi>Breues</hi> were grounded vpon falſe informations, for that there is no ſuch thing denyed in the Oath, as I haue euidently conuinced, howſoeuer Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to prooue the contrarie. And neither of theſe anſweres can bee ſufficiently confuted by any of my <hi>Aduerſaries,</hi> neither are they repugnant to the ſubmiſſion of my writings to the <hi>Catholike Roman Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="40">40 So as you ſee that I made not that irreuerent inference, which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> heere concludeth. I affirmed onely the <hi>Minor</hi> propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, to wit, that his <hi>Holineſſe Breues</hi> condemning the <hi>Oath,</hi> for that <hi>it containeth many things flat contrarie to faith, and ſaluation,</hi> were groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon an vncertaine and fallible foundation or doctrine, and light, that is, not weightie enough to make a matter of faith, to wit, that it is againſt faith to ſay, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath not power to depoſe <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> &amp;c. and vpon <hi>falſe informations,</hi> to wit, that his power to <hi>excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate,</hi> to binde and looſe in generall, and conſequently his ſpirituall Supremacie is denyed in the Oath; and both theſe my aſſertions I haue ſufficiently conuinced to bee true. But this ſilly man thinking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to lay a foule aſperſion vpon mee of irreuerence, and ſmall reſpect to his <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> doth himſelfe adde the <hi>Maior</hi> propoſition not affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by mee, and therein he plainly ſheweth his owne irreuerence, and ſmall reſpect to his <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> and to many other <hi>Popes,</hi> accuſing him and them by this <hi>Maior</hi> propoſition, which hee addeth, <hi>to bee the moſt careleſſe and negligent Paſtours, that euer gouerned the Church of God.</hi> For this is his <hi>Maior</hi> propoſition, <hi>whoſoeuer affirmeth, that his</hi> Holineſſe Breues <hi>were grounded vpon light, or vncertaine</hi> foundations, <hi>and</hi> falſe informations, <hi>muſt needes hold him to bee the moſt careleſſe and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Paſtour that euer gouerned the Church of God;</hi> by which his aſſertion hee plainely ſheweth what little reſpect and reuerence hee beareth to his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> and ſundrie other <hi>Popes,</hi> who oftentimes, as I ſhewed before out of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third,<note n="t" place="margin">In the Canon, Anobis <hi>2.</hi> de ſent.

               <pb n="578" facs="tcp:150436:307"/>
God <hi>is bound by a Cenſure of the</hi> Church.

            </p>
            <p n="41">41 For my owne part I neither made that irreuerent inference, which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> heere collected, but hee himſelfe out of his want of learning and iudgement broached and inuented that irreuerent <hi>Maior</hi> propoſition, from whence, if it were generally true, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference may indeed be gathered as well concerning his <hi>Holineſſe Breues,</hi> as alſo the Decrees and iudiciall ſentences of other Popes, wherein as Pope <hi>Innocentius</hi> himſelfe acknowledged they are ſometimes lead, not by trueth, but by opinion, and information, which oftentimes is falſe, and both deceiueth, and is deceiued: neither did I deny, that his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> before hee publiſhed his <hi>Breues,</hi> vſed graue, long, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deliberation concerning all things contained therein; albeit I muſt needes confeſſe, that hee might haue vſed a more graue, long, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deliberation, if hee would haue conſulted the matter not onely with his owne Diuines of <hi>Rome,</hi> but alſo with thoſe of <hi>France,</hi> and theſe of <hi>England</hi> whom moſt of all it concerned: and doubtleſſe hee might by them haue had a more ſufficient information of the whole matter and controuerſie, then hee had by his owne <hi>Diuines</hi> alone, as the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent ſheweth to bee very true. But whether this his graue, mature, and long deliberation, and conſultation with his Diuines onely of <hi>Rome,</hi> was ſufficient to excuſe him from all careleſneſſe, and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence before the ſight and iudgment of God, I will not, as I ſaid before, it being a thing not knowne to mee, meddle therewith: neither will I accuſe, or excuſe his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> from ſinne for ſending hither his <hi>Breues</hi> ſo preiudiciall to the <hi>Kings Maiestie,</hi> and to all his Catholike ſubiects, without making a more graue, long, and mature deliberation and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion, but I leaue it to the iudgement of almightie God, who onely knoweth the ſecrets of all mens hearts, when through ignorance or negligence they commit any offence.

            <p n="59">59 But in very deed I am aſhamed that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> ſhould ſtill ſo ſhamefully be wray his egregious fraude and ignorance.

where no danger ariſeth to the publike good, or to a third perſon, in a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full matter we muſt for the most part obey.

            <p n="95">95 To conclude therefore this digreſſion, it is euident by the premiſes, that if the <hi>Pope</hi> without a generall <hi>Councell</hi> define any doctrine to be hereticall, erroneous, or temerarious, and command all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes to belieue the ſame, no Catholike is bound, or ought to belieue with Catholike faith, that doctrine to be hereticall, erroneous, or te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merarious for this reſpect onely, becauſe the <hi>Pope</hi> hath defined and commanded the ſame, for that it is a controuerſie among learned Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, whether he hath any ſuch authority infallibly to define or no; and conſequently neither his definitions, nor his <hi>declaratiue</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements grounded thereon, can be certaine and infallible grounds of <hi>Catholike faith.</hi> And thus much touching inward beliefe.
